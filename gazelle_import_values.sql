This is called your \"required ratio\". If your upload/download ratio goes below your required ratio, your account will be given a two week period to fix it before you lose your ability to download. This is called \"ratio watch\". \r\n[*] The required ratio is [b]NOT the extra amount of ratio you need to gain[/b]. It is the [b]minimum[/b] required ratio you must maintain. \r\n[*] Your required ratio is unique, and is calculated from the amount you\'ve downloaded, and the percentage of your snatched torrents which you are still seeding (for a detailed explanation see below). \r\n\r\n[b][size=4]Important information you should know[/size][/b]\r\n\r\n[*] If your ratio does not meet your required ratio, you will be put on ratio watch. You will have [b]two weeks[/b] to get your ratio above your required ratio - [b]failure to do so will result in your downloading privileges being automatically disabled[/b]. \r\n[*] If you download over 10GB while you\'re on ratio watch, you will be instantly disabled. \r\n[*] Everyone gets to download their first 5GB before ratio watch kicks in.\r\n[*] [b]To get out of ratio watch, you must either raise your ratio by uploading more, or lower your required ratio by seeding more. Your ratio MUST be above your required ratio.[/b]\r\n[*] If you have lost your downloading privileges, your new required ratio will be the 0% seeded ratio. You will re-gain your downloading privileges once your ratio is above that required ratio. \r\n[*] The ratio watch system is completely automatic, and cannot be altered by staff. \r\n\r\n[b][size=4]Required ratio details[/size][/b]\r\n\r\n[b]It is not necessary to know how this ratio is calculated. What you need to know is that downloading makes the required ratio go up (bad) and seeding your snatches forever makes your required ratio go down (good). You can view your required ratio in the site header (it is the \"Required\" value). You want a high ratio, and a low required ratio.[/b]\r\n\r\nThe exact formula for calculating the required ratio is provided merely for the curious. It is done in three steps. \r\n\r\nThe first step is by determining how high and how low your required ratio can be. This is determined by looking up how much you\'ve downloaded from the following table:\r\n[ratiolist]\r\n\r\nSo for example, if you\'ve downloaded 25GB, your required ratio will be somewhere between 0.05 and 0.30. \r\n\r\nTo get this range of requirements to a more precise number, what we do is take the required ratio (0% seeded) for your download band, multiply it by: [tex]1-\\frac{Seeding}{Snatched}[/tex], and round it up to the required ratio (100% seeded) if need be. Therefore, your required ratio will always lie between the 0% seeded and 100% seeded requirements, depending on the percentage of torrents you are seeding. \r\n		\r\nIn the formula, \"snatched\" is the number of [b]non-deleted unique snatches[/b] (complete downloads) you have made (so if you snatch a torrent twice, it only counts once, and if it is then deleted, it\'s not counted at all). \"Seeding\" is the average number of torrents you\'ve seeded over at least 72 hours in the past week. If you\'ve seeded less than 72 hours in the past week, the \"seeding\" value will go down (which is bad). \r\n		\r\nThus, if you have downloaded less than 20GB, and you are seeding 100% of your snatches, you will have [b]no required ratio[/b]. If you have downloaded less than 5GB, then no matter what percentage of snatches you are seeding, you will again have no required ratio. \r\n\r\nIf you stop seeding for an entire week, your required ratio will be the \"required ratio (0% seeded)\" for your download band. Your required ratio will go down once you start seeding again. \r\n\r\nTake note how, as your download increases, the [b]0% seeded and 100% seeded required ratios begin to taper together[/b]. They meet at 100GB of download, meaning that after you\'ve downloaded 100GB, your ratio requirement will be 0.60, no matter what percentage of your snatches you\'re seeding.

This means actually describing the scene!\r\n\r\n[u]the long version:[/u]\r\n\r\nYou need to describe the content of the video/movie/clip/whatever.  There seems to be a lot of confusion about what is and what is not a description.\r\n\r\nFirst off what is the point of a description?  There are several points.  First image hosts go down!  Image hosts delete images after a period of time.  We want the overall presentation of the torrent to stand the test of time.  The only way to insure that is by having a text description of the content.  Secondly, we want anyone who views the presentation to be able to figure out the content of the video without prior knowledge.\r\n\r\n[color=blue]You can find a list of sites for descriptions [url=http://torrents.empornium.me/forums.php?action=viewtopic&topicid=3898]HERE[/url] [/color]\r\n\r\nWhat is not a description:\r\n\r\n1) Hyperbole -- I got this from Cheggit, I found this on kazza, I found this on an old Hard Drive, etc etc etc while that is interesting it is not a description.  Saying that this was released on a specific date is interesting and it marks it as a new fresh (or not so fresh) upload which is great . . . but that does not describe the content.  Saying things like \"the action is obvious from the title\" or \"the screens say it all\" is not a text description of the content.\r\n\r\n2) Reviews/personal opinion -- We know the uploader likes the content they would not have uploaded it otherwise.  Stating that the video won this award or that award is interesting but it does nothing to describe the content.\r\n\r\n3) Technical information -- the resolution and running time and size and codec and frame rate are important information but they alone do not a description of the content make.\r\n\r\n4) Model/actress/Website/producer information -- the name of the models again is interesting but does not a description make.  For example telling me that Bobbi Starr is in the movie tells us nothing about the content.  She has done many movies in just about every genre -- we need details.  Just because the uploader knows that Fu Bar from who-gives-a-crap-istan only does a certain type of movie does not mean that everyone who looks at the torrent page knows that.  Again useful information but it is not a substitute for a description.  Just because the uploader knows that everything from producer X or website Y has more or less the same plot does not mean that every person on the site knows that!\r\n\r\n5) Tag lines from the DVD cover -- things like \"Anal Overdrive: Hey mister, give me a ride!\" do not adequately describe the content of the video.\r\n\r\nAll of that can be part of good description but none of them make up a description on their own or together.\r\n\r\nSome examples of bad/unacceptable descriptions:\r\n\r\n[quote]Title - Hot Webcam Latina\r\n\r\nTags - latina fake boobs webcam big butt\r\n\r\nDesc - Hot Webcam Latina[/quote]\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n[quote]My collection of anal vids collected over 8 years of collecting. Enjoy, theres some hot stuff in there.[/quote]\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n[quote]My collection of anal vids, this is part one I will be uploading my entire collection in several parts over the coming weeks. So keep an eye out :wink:[/quote]\r\n\r\nYes these are all real world examples taken off the site in the last few days!\r\n\r\nWhen we say we need a better description we want to see something like:\r\n\r\n[quote]Classic pizza guy scene.  Pizza guys come to deliver a bunch of pies but the hot blonde can not pay for them . . . whatever will she do?  Of course she lets the pizza guy fuck the shit out of her.[/quote]\r\n\r\nThat is an example of a descent but minimal description.\r\n\r\nA better description would be:\r\n\r\n[quote]Classic pizza guy scene.  Pizza guy comes to deliver a pie but the hot blonde can not pay for it . . . whatever will she do?  She notices that the pizza guy looks well hung and she lustily glares at his crotch.  After a little chat she starts rubbing his cock through his pants.  This is followed up by her giving him a blow job for a while.  During the blow job both of them get undressed.  After a bit he decides to return the favor and he starts eating her out.  Missionary sex follows.  He convinces her to go doggy as he fucks her from behind.  \"Well this is nice but if you want 5 free pies you are going to have to do a little bit more\" he tells her.  She says \"Whatever could you mean?\".  He responds by sliding his dick up to her asshole.  After a bit of half hearted arguing she complies.  Eventually they switch to reverse cowgirl as she bounces her ass up and down on his member.  The scene finishes up with him shooting his load all over her face and he leaves without the pizzas with only the memory of a great sexual encounter as payment.[/quote]\r\n\r\nThe best description would add on the name of all of the models and all of the technical information to the second description.\r\n\r\nWe know that many uploaders do not watch the videos before they post them.  We also know that many uploaders speak a language other than English as their primary language.  We even know that some of you are just not that comfortable writing descriptions.  For those of you like that . . . it is often very easy to find out who the producer/publisher/website of the video/clip/scene/movie is.  Go to that producers/publishers/whatever website and simply copy the description provided by them.\r\n\r\nMegapack Descriptions\r\n\r\nPacks can be much more difficult.  First off if you are making a pack of many videos they should be related in such a way that you can describe the content of the pack in a few sentences.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[quote=Ghetto Gaggers partial site rip]\r\nHere is a bunch of content I have collected from GhettoGaggers.com. They all contain deep throat gagging of black women. Some contain puking. Most include anal and vaginal sex. Some have DP. I think there is even pissing in one or two.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote=Strapon Cum partial site rip]\r\nHot, juicy young girls in sexy, kinky outfits play and fuck each other with big strapon that... Squirts loads of hot gooey cum![/quote]\r\n\r\n[quote=StraponDreamer partial site rip]\r\nFor those of you who are not familiar with the site the content is pretty straight forward.  There is a usually very attractive female fucking a guy with a strapon.  What differentiates this site from others is that the female usually appears to be genuinely enjoying the whole scene.  Also the females are generally much more attractive than on most sites.  There is little to none of that typical strapon scene stuff where the the female is berating the male calling them worthless or whatever.  There is even one girl girl scene.  Most of the videos have little to no dialogue . . . but those that do have dialogue are in English.[/quote]\r\n\r\nThose are all perfectly acceptable descriptions of the content of a few site rips.\r\n\r\nA better description would include the names of some/most of the models and all pertinent technical information.\r\n\r\nFor a site rip that technical information can vary quite a bit.  To cover that saying something like the following is perfectly adequate:\r\n\r\nMost of these videos are 720p.  The earliest videos were only 480p and the latest videos are 1080p.  Most are in AVI with a few mp4\'s.\r\n\r\nThe best descriptions would include all of the above but every video/scene/whatever would be described in detail as well.\r\n\r\nWhere packs get difficult is when the pack is for a specific model or a specific category.  Say you made a pack of Bobbi Star\'s anal scenes . . . that would be easy to describe briefly:\r\n\r\n[quote]Check out these 10 scenes where Bobbi Star takes it up the poop shoot long and hard![/quote] \r\n\r\nThat is an example of a descent but minimal description.\r\n\r\nHowever, a Bobbi Star pack that has for example all of her kink.com shoots from 2009 (or whatever) would be very very difficult to sum up in a few sentences.  Just do your best to describe why you choose to make a pack like that and you should be ok (as long as those reasons describe the content).  An acceptable description would be something like:\r\n\r\nI just love Bobbi Star\'s unbridled enthusiasm for bondage and sex.  In her kink.com\'s scenes from 2009 you can really see how varied her desires are in scenes from several of the kink.com sites like: Everything Butt (anal play), Device Bondage (bondage in hard metal devices), Ultimate Surrender (wrestling), Whipped Ass (spanking), and Fucking Machines (girls getting pleasured by various machines).\r\n\r\nAn unnaceptable description would be:\r\n\r\nBobbi Star is just just so fucking hot check her out in these scenes from kink.com shot in 2009.\r\n\r\nAgain the best description would describe each scene in detail and have accurate model and technical information.\r\n[*] All users must use an [url=/articles.php?topic=ApprovedImg]APPROVED image host![/url]\r\n[*] DO NOT try to \"slip one by\" - ALL Torrents are checked on a daily basis!!\r\n[*] Always do a search to make sure that what you want to share isn\'t already posted here!\r\n[*] Duped torrents will be deleted!\r\n\r\n\r\n[b][size=2]DUPES[/size][/b]\r\n\r\n[*] An upload is considered a dupe if a file of the same size and format has already been posted either as a single file upload or as part of a larger torrent. If the original torrent is no longer active please use the reseed request button on the torrent page, if a reseed request hasn\'t been filled within 2 weeks you are allowed to repost the content.\r\n[*] Posting a megapack or site rip that includes content that has already been posted (for the sake of completeness) is allowed as long as it contains a proportional amount of new material as well. When in doubt you can always consult a staff member for a pre-emptive ruling using the Contact link.\r\n[*] Split-scenes of previously uploaded full movies are not considered dupes.\r\n[*] Always add an anonymizer (http://anonym.to/http://your link here) in front of direct links to porn sites.\r\n[*] Make sure your torrents are well-seeded, at least 3-4 other seeders before you stop.\r\n[*] Use the BBCode Sandbox before uploading if you are unsure about how to use bbcodes. - A basic bbcode tutorial can be found [url=/articles.php?topic=bbcode]HERE[/url].\r\n[*] DO NOT add commentary to your uploads making veiled threats that you will not upload unless you get comments or something else you seek. If you don\'t want to upload, then don\'t do so. Making veiled threats only causes more problems than they are worth. So don\'t do it!\r\n[*] Multiple resolution versions of a file are welcome at EMPornium but must be uploaded separately from now on. Since very few peers will want to download the same vid in multiple resolutions, this kind of torrent suffers from an unnecessarily short lifespan. Furthermore no bonus credits are awarded to the users seeding just one version of the video(s) contained in such torrents.

The videos and the pictures. Again using meaningful names helps. If you have a big number of pictures like more than say 100 put them in a zip file. uTorrent has a known problem with a big number of files.\r\nscreens are very important. Make sure you include them. Refer to the making screens help section if you need. Here is a good example.\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=3C57_502BC5C5[/img]\r\n\r\nPrepare your pictures, screens, description, tag list in advance.

Most online databases and search engines support Boolean searches. Boolean search techniques can be used to carry out effective searches, cutting out many unrelated documents.\r\n\r\n[b]Is Boolean Search Complicated?[/b]\r\nUsing Boolean Logic to broaden and/or narrow your search is not as complicated as it sounds; in fact, you might already be doing it. Boolean logic is just the term used to describe certain logical operations that are used to combine search terms in many search engine databases and directories on the Net. It\'s not rocket science, but it sure sounds fancy (try throwing this phrase out in common conversation!).\r\n\r\n[b]Basic Boolean Search Operators - AND (&)[/b]\r\nUsing AND narows a search by combining terms; it will retrieve documents that use both the search terms you specify, as in this example:\r\n\r\nblowjob and facial, can also be written as blowjob & facial.\r\n\r\nThere is always an implicit AND operator, so \"hello world\" query actually means \"hello and world\".\r\n\r\n[b]Basic Boolean Search Operators - OR (|)[/b]\r\nUsing OR broadens a search to include results that contain either of the words you type in. OR is a good tool to use when there are several common spellings or synonyms of a word, as in this example:\r\n\r\nhardcore or softcore, can also be written as hardcore | softcore.\r\n\r\n[b]Basic Boolean Search Operators - NOT (!,-)[/b]\r\nUsing NOT will narrow a search by excluding certain search terms. NOT retrieves documents that contain one, but not the other, of the search terms you enter, as in this example:\r\n\r\nhardcore not facial, can also be written as hardcore -facial or even hardcore !facial.\r\n\r\n[b]Boolean Grouping - ( )[/b]\r\nWith parentheses you can group different statements together, like in this example:\r\n\r\n(cat not dog) or (cat not mouse), or as (cat -dog ) | (cat -mouse).\r\n','2012-10-23 20:53:28'),(28,0,1,'download',0,'Download','These are the rules that govern downloading','[center][color=#0261a3][size=5][font=Arial Black]Downloading rules[/font][/size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Please note that by not following these rules there is a strong chance you will lose your downloading privileges!

If you have a low ratio, you could grab a Free Leech torrent (which is designated by a gold spinning coin), or you could try uploading something new. Always grabbing what you want might not be a good idea as it may already be over seeded. It\'s a good idea to try to build a good healthy ratio first before you attempt to download everything you may want right away.\r\n[*]Be aware, a trap many members fall into is assuming that low seed/high leech ratios on a given torrent always means they have potential to seed back data. While this is a method of selecting torrents to help ratio, it may not always be the case. If a torrent has more than one file, and a member only downloads select parts of it, they will never be shown as a seeder, they will always show as a leecher. You will not seed any data to those individuals as they already have all they desired of that torrent. Please be mindful of that fact of bit torrent life. If the torrent is a few days old, then its highly likely that many leeches are in fact, \'pseudo\' leechers.\r\n[*]Do not complain to the Staff or blame the tracker if your stats or bonus credits aren\'t correct.

(a.k.a. \"Summary Ban\")\r\nThe server is overloaded and unresponsive. \r\nJust try to keep the session open until the server responds again. \r\n(Flooding the server with consecutive manual updates is not recommended.)\r\nYou are using a faulty client. \r\nIf you want to use an experimental or CVS version you do it at your own risk.\r\nYou should also check which clients have been reported as \"not supported\" in the forums.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nBest practices[spoiler= ]If a torrent you are currently leeching/seeding is not listed on your profile, just wait or force a manual update.  \r\nMake sure you exit your client properly, so that the tracker receives \"event=completed\"!!!.\r\nIf the tracker is down, do not stop seeding. \r\nAs long as the tracker is back up before you exit the client the stats should update properly.\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nMay I use any bittorrent client?[spoiler= ]No!\r\n\r\nThe following clients are banned for various reasons (cheating e.t.c)\r\n\r\n*Bitlord\r\n*Bitcomet\r\n*Torrentstorm\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure that you check the often updated list of malfunctioning/not supported clients/client versions in the forums.\r\n\r\nAlso, any clients in alpha or beta version should be avoided.\r\n\r\nWe recommend the following clients in Stable versions:\r\n\r\nÂµTorrent\r\nVuze/Azureus\r\nrTorrent\r\n\r\nHowever, even these clients go through updates that create bugs!\r\nSo you need to keep up to date with the latest reported client problems and fixes![/spoiler]\r\n\r\nWhy is a torrent I\'m leeching/seeding listed several times in my profile?[spoiler= ]If for some reason (e.g. pc crash, or frozen client) your client exits improperly and you restart it, it will have a new peer_id, so it will show as a new torrent.  The old one will never receive an \"event=completed\" or \"event=stopped\" and will be listed until some tracker timeout. Just ignore it, it will eventually go away.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nI\'ve finished or cancelled a torrent. Why is it still listed in my profile?[spoiler= ]Some clients, notably TorrentStorm and Nova Torrent, do not report properly to the tracker when canceling or finishing a torrent. In that case the tracker will keep waiting for some message - and thus listing the torrent as seeding or leeching - until some timeout occurs. Just ignore it, it will eventually go away.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nWhy do I sometimes see torrents I\'m not leeching in my profile!?[spoiler= ]When a torrent is first started, the tracker uses the IP to identify the user.  Therefore the torrent will become associated with the user who last accessed the site from that IP. \r\n\r\nIf you share your IP in some way (you are behind NAT/ICS, or using a proxy), and some of the persons you share it with are also users, you may occasionally see their torrents listed in your profile. \r\n(If they start a torrent session from that IP and you were the last one to visit the site the torrent will be associated with you). \r\nNote that now torrents listed in your profile will always count towards your total stats.\r\n\r\nTo make sure your torrents show up in your profile you should visit the site immediately before starting a session.\r\n\r\n(The only way to completely stop foreign torrents from showing in profiles is to forbid users without an individual IP from accessing the site. \r\nYes, that means you. Complain at your own risk.)[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nMultiple IPs (Can I login from different computers?)[spoiler= ]Yes, our tracker is using the passkey system, so the ip of the user is of no relevance, as the identification of the user is being done by the means of checking the user\'s passkey and not the IP.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nHow does NAT/ICS change the picture?[spoiler= ]This is a very particular case in that all computers in the LAN will appear to the outside world as having the same IP. \r\n\r\nWe must distinguish between two cases:\r\n\r\n1. You are the single torrents.empornium.me users in the LAN\r\n\r\nYou should use the same torrents.empornium.me account in all the computers.\r\n\r\nNote also that in the ICS case it is preferable to run the BT client on the ICS gateway. Clients running on the other computers will be unconnectable (they will be listed as such, as explained elsewhere in the FAQ) unless you specify the appropriate services in your ICS configuration (a good explanation of how to do this for Windows XP can be found here). \r\n\r\nIn the NAT case you should configure different ranges for clients on different computers and create appropriate NAT rules in the router. (Details vary widely from router to router and are outside the scope of this FAQ. Check your router documentation and/or support forum.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. There are multiple torrents.empornium.me users in the LAN\r\n\r\nAt present there is no way of making this setup always work properly with torrents.empornium.me. Each torrent will be associated with the user who last accessed the site  from within the LAN before the torrent was started. \r\n\r\nUnless there is cooperation between the users mixing of statistics is possible. (User A accesses the site, downloads a .torrent file, but does not start the torrent immediately. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, user B accesses the site. User A then starts the torrent. The torrent will count towards user B\'s statistics, not user A\'s.)\r\n\r\nIt is your LAN, the responsibility is yours. Do not ask us to ban other users with the same IP, we will not do that. (Why should we ban him instead of you?)[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=4][font=Arial Black]Downloading:[/font][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I improve my download speed?[spoiler= ]\r\n1. Do not immediately jump on new torrents. Wait until the seeder/leecher ratio improves a bit.\r\n\r\n2. Make yourself connectable http://empornium.mooo.com/articles.php?topic=connectable\r\nMany have connectability issues that affects their upload/download speed and stats.\r\n\r\n3. Limit your upload speed\r\nThe upload speed affects the download speed in essentially two ways:\r\n\r\n    Bittorrent peers tend to favour those other peers that upload to them. This means that if A and B are leeching the same torrent and A is sending data to B at high speed then B will try to reciprocate. So due to this effect high upload speeds lead to high download speeds.\r\n    Due to the way TCP works, when A is downloading something from B it has to keep telling B that it received the data sent to him. (These are called acknowledgements - ACKs -, a sort of \"got it!\" messages). If A fails to do this then B will stop sending data and wait. If A is uploading at full speed there may be no bandwidth left for the ACKs and they will be delayed. So due to this effect excessively high upload speeds lead to low download speeds.\r\n\r\nThe full effect is a combination of the two. The upload should be kept as high as possible while allowing the ACKs to get through without delay. A good thumb rule is keeping the upload at about 80% of the theoretical upload speed. You will have to fine tune yours to find out what works best for you. (Remember that keeping the upload high has the additional benefit of helping with your ratio.)\r\n\r\nIf you are running more than one instance of a client it is the overall upload speed that you must take into account. Some clients limit global upload speed, others do it on a per torrent basis. Know your client. The same applies if you are using your connection for anything else (e.g. browsing or ftp), always think of the overall upload speed.\r\n\r\n4. Limit the number of simultaneous connections\r\nSome operating systems (like Windows 9x) do not deal well with a large number of connections, and may even crash. Also some home routers (particularly when running NAT and/or firewall with stateful inspection services) tend to become slow or crash when having to deal with too many connections. There are no fixed values for this, you may try 60 or 100 and experiment with the value. Note that these numbers are cumulative, if you have two instances of a client running the numbers add up.\r\n\r\n5. Limit the number of simultaneous uploads\r\nIsn\'t this the same as above? No. Connections limit the number of peers your client is talking to and/or downloading from. Uploads limit the number of peers your client is actually uploading to. The ideal number is typically much lower than the number of connections, and highly dependent on your (physical) connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Just give it some time\r\nAs explained above peers favour other peers that upload to them. When you start leeching a new torrent you have nothing to offer to other peers and they will tend to ignore you. This makes the starts slow, in particular if, by chance, the peers you are connected to include few or no seeders. The download speed should increase as soon as you have some pieces to share.\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nWhy can\'t I connect? Is the site blocking me?[spoiler= ]The tracker has determined that you are firewalled or NATed and cannot accept incoming connections.\r\n\r\nThis means that other peers in the swarm will be unable to connect to you, only you to them. Even worse, if two peers are both in this state they will not be able to connect at all. This obviously has a detrimental effect on the overall speed.\r\n\r\nThe way to solve the problem involves opening the ports used for incoming connections (the same range you defined in your client) on the firewall and/or configuring your NAT server to use a basic form of NAT for that range instead of NAPT (the actual process differs widely between different router models. Check your router documentation and/or support forum. You will also find lots of information on the subject at http://portforward.com/[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nMy ISP uses a transparent proxy. What should I do?[spoiler= ]\r\nCaveat: This is a large and complex topic. It is not possible to cover all variations here.\r\n\r\nShort reply: change to an ISP that does not force a proxy upon you. If you cannot or do not want to then read on.\r\n\r\nWhat is a proxy?\r\n\r\nBasically a middleman. When you are browsing a site through a proxy your requests are sent to the proxy and the proxy forwards them to the site instead of you connecting directly to the site. There are several classifications (the terminology is far from standard):\r\n\r\nTransparent   A transparent proxy is one that needs no configuration on the clients. It works by automatically redirecting all port 80 traffic to the proxy. (Sometimes used as synonymous for non-anonymous.)\r\nExplicit/Voluntary   Clients must configure their browsers to use them.\r\n\r\nAnonymous   The proxy sends no client identification to the server. (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR header is not sent; the server does not see your IP.)\r\n\r\nHighly Anonymous   The proxy sends no client nor proxy identification to the server. (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, HTTP_VIA and HTTP_PROXY_CONNECTION headers are not sent; the server doesn\'t see your IP and doesn\'t even know you\'re using a proxy.)\r\nPublic   (Self explanatory)\r\n\r\nA transparent proxy may or may not be anonymous, and there are several levels of anonymity.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I find out if I\'m behind a (transparent/anonymous) proxy?\r\n\r\nTry ProxyJudge. It lists the HTTP headers that the server where it is running received from you. The relevant ones are HTTP_CLIENT_IP, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR and REMOTE_ADDR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy am I listed as not connectable even though I\'m not NAT/Firewalled?\r\n\r\nThe torrents.empornium.me tracker is quite smart at finding your real IP, but it does need the proxy to send the HTTP header HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR. If your ISP\'s proxy does not then what happens is that the tracker will interpret the proxy\'s IP address as the client\'s IP address. So when you login and the tracker tries to connect to your client to see if you are NAT/firewalled it will actually try to connect to the proxy on the port your client reports to be using for incoming connections. Naturally the proxy will not be listening on that port, the connection will fail and the tracker will think you are NAT/firewalled.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I bypass my ISP\'s proxy?\r\n\r\nIf your ISP only allows HTTP traffic through port 80 or blocks the usual proxy ports then you would need to use something like socks and that is outside the scope of this FAQ.\r\n\r\nThe site accepts connections on port 81 besides the usual 80, and using them may be enough to fool some proxies. So the first thing to try should be connecting to http://torrents.empornium.me:81. Note that even if this works your bt client will still try to connect to port 80 unless you edit the announce url in the .torrent file.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you may try the following:\r\n\r\n   Choose any public non-anonymous proxy that does not use port 80 (e.g. from this, this or this list).\r\n   Configure your computer to use that proxy. For Windows XP, do Start, Control Panel, Internet Options, Connections, LAN Settings, Use a Proxy server, Advanced and type in the IP and port of your chosen proxy. Or from Internet Explorer use Tools, Internet Options, ...\r\n   (Facultative) Visit ProxyJudge. If you see an HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR in the list followed by your IP then everything should be ok, otherwise choose another proxy and try again.\r\n   Visit torrents.empornium.me. Hopefully the tracker will now pickup your real IP (check your profile to make sure).\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that now you will be doing all your browsing through a public proxy, which are typically quite slow. Communications between peers do not use port 80 so their speed will not be affected by this, and should be better than when you were \"unconnectable\".\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I make my bittorrent client use a proxy?\r\n\r\nJust configure Windows XP as above. When you configure a proxy for Internet Explorer you\'re actually configuring a proxy for all HTTP traffic (thank Microsoft and their \"IE as part of the OS policy\" ). On the other hand if you use another browser (Opera/Mozilla/Firefox) and configure a proxy there you\'ll be configuring a proxy just for that browser. We don\'t know of any BT client that allows a proxy to be specified explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy can\'t I signup from behind a proxy?\r\nIt is our policy not to allow new accounts to be opened from behind a proxy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes this apply to other torrent sites?\r\n\r\nThis section was written for torrents.empornium.me, a closed, port 80-81 tracker. Other trackers may be open or closed, and many listen on e.g. ports 6868 or 6969. The above does not necessarily apply to other trackers.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy can\'t I connect? Is the site blocking me?[spoiler= ]\r\n\r\nFirst of all don\'t assume you are connectable.\r\n \r\nMany people assume they are connectable, because they are successfully torrenting. That however is not always the case.\r\n \r\nWhat does it mean to be connectable?\r\n \r\nBeing connectable means other peers in the swarm can make connections to you, you can make connections to other peers without being connectable your self, if the other peers in your swarm are good enough torrent citizens to be connectable.\r\n \r\n\r\nWhy does it matter?\r\n \r\nWell, many private trackers restrict people who aren\'t connectable, and on some sites no seed bonuses are credited to people who aren\'t. Most importantly people who aren\'t connectable hurt the swarm. Each peer that isn\'t connectable is limited to sharing with only peers who are connectable. If the number of peers who aren\'t connectable is low the result is unnoticeable. But the higher the percentage goes the slower the swarm becomes until it dies at the point when all peers are unconnectable. There\'s no one left to connect to.\r\n \r\n\r\nWhy am I unconnectable? Well maybe...\r\n \r\n - Lack of proper port forwarding.  http://empornium.mooo.com/forums.php?action=viewthread&threadid=1445\r\n - TURN OFF DHT, PEER EXCHANGE, LOCAL PEER DISCOVERY\r\n - Bandwidth oversaturation, incoming or outgoing.\r\n - Too many torrents started at once.\r\n - Too many connections per torrent, or total.\r\n - ISP blocking chosen port\r\n - Router not P2P friendly\r\n - ISP modem contains router features\r\n - ISP proxying or firewalling your connection\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat can I do about it?\r\n \r\nSometimes nothing. For instance if your ISP has you behind a proxy server that blocks incoming requests. If they\'re only blocking certain ports you can change the port you use, and if they\'re throttling (this has nothing to do with becoming connectable.) you could use uTorrent or Azureus and enable encryption. It may be that you are trying to torrent from a place of business with routers, proxy servers, firewalls, and/or traffic shaping software, or appliances like websense. If you\'re even lucky enough to get a torrent running at all, but being connectable is out of the question. However, most cases being connectable is fun, easy and can be done without spending any money at all.\r\n \r\n\r\nFirst, make sure any anti-virus software you use isn\'t blocking any ports you use for torrenting\r\n \r\nSecond, set your firewall to give full access to your torrent program, don\'t block it in any way.\r\n \r\nThird, set your bandwidth limits in your torrent software, if you let it use all your bandwidth to share information with your peers there may not be enough to browse the internet or communicate with the tracker. Not being able to communicate with the tracker in a timely fashion may cause the tracker to list you as unconnectable when you are in fact connectable. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net - The Global Broadband Speed Test to find your up and down speeds, set your client for around 80% outgoing and 90% to 95% incoming. These numbers aren\'t set in stone so feel free to play a little but make sure you are connectable first and be prepared to change them back if you run into problems.\r\n \r\nFourth, don\'t shutdown or start your software with a lot of torrents running. whats a lot? I think 3 would be OK, but 10 is out. The point is shut down and start your torrents individually or groups of 2 or 3 with a pause between, and if you shutdown your computer wait for your start up programs to finish before starting your torrents back up.\r\n \r\nFifth, limit the number of connections per torrent and total connections. Defaults will usually work but maybe shrink it down more if you\'re still showing up unconnectable.\r\n \r\nSixth, make sure your modem doesnt have routing features. Some newer modems have features but are not heavily configurable so the easiest thing to do is to turn these features off if possible.\r\n \r\nSeventh, your router may just not be good at handling P2P protocols like BitTorrent which require many connections made over a short time. \r\n\r\nAll routers have a limited number of connections they can handle being open at any one time, some leave connections open for too long, most notably LINKSYS WRT54G/GL/GS routers. There are fixes for this but it involves upgrading to beta or possibly third-party firmware, which always carries risks. If you think this applies to you follow the faq on uTorrent\'s or whatever client you are using site but proceed with the utmost caution.\r\n \r\nEighth, try using ports between 65,000 and 65,500 this works better for most people, and do not use software like PeerGuardian2. TURN OFF DHT, PEER EXCHANGE, and LOCAL PEER DISCOVERY\r\n \r\nFinally, and this can be the hardest part for most people, follow one of many very good guides concerning port forwarding. Port Forwarding Guides Listed by Manufacturer and Model - PortForward.com is a good place to start. http://portforward.com\r\n \r\n1. Setup your computer to a static ip there are very good guides for this at portforward select your operating system and follow the guide.\r\n \r\n2. Next you need to setup your router to forward the correct ports to your computer. A step by step guide for just about every router is located at PortForward\'s Other Guides - PortForward.com , scroll down and select port forwarding guides by router. Just select your router, and \r\nthen click on your bit-torrent client for specific steps on how to correctly configure your setup. Remember to use the IP address you assigned your computer in step one. Also, the port number can be almost anything you want, but I suggest using something over 50,000. \r\n\r\n3. If you run a firewall you\'ll need to set it up to allow the correct traffic. Go to Port Forwarding Guides Listed by Manufacturer and Model - PortForward.com select the firewall you have and follow the steps.\r\n \r\n4. Once you\'ve set up all of that, make sure your client is running, then go to Open Port Check Tool\r\nenter in the port you\'re using. This page will tell you whether your port is open, stealthed, or closed. If it is open, then you should be Connectable.\r\n \r\nWhats the reason for all this?\r\n \r\nWhy have your computer set to a static IP?\r\n\r\nOn networks where DCHP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is running you get an IP address issued automatically when you connect. In theory this is great but until you connect you donâ€™t know what this IP address will be. Most routers have a set range of IP addresses to use but how these are issued depends on the make/model of the router. \r\nSo if you set up port forwarding for the IP currently issued to your PC today, will it work tomorrow or even after a reboot? Maybe but if the PC gets issued a different IP address your PC will never see the data on the ports you forwarded. How can you be sure of always having the port forwarded to the right computer port â€“ simple set up a static IP address. That way every time the computer restarts it will be the same IP address and the port forwarding will work perfectly.\r\n \r\nWhy be connectable (or what happens when you are not?)\r\n \r\nA 1gig torrent is uploaded. The uploader starts seeding. 9 leechers jump on to the torrent. The torrent is going very slow. He has already seeded 5GB but no one has completed. Turns out they are all unconnectable. This means that the uploader needs to send 1gig of data to each of them. If he stops seeding before they have completed the torrent it will dry up and no more data will be transferred.\r\n \r\nAnother example:\r\n\r\nYou find the torrent. There\'s 10 seeders. You\'re hopeful for good speeds. Your PC starts looking for bits. The speed is slow and you only seem to be connecting to 1 seeder.... WTH!!! Well if 9 are not connectable this means you\'ll not be able to leech very much from them and at very slow speeds. \r\n\r\nThe essence of this guide is not to get you individually faster download speeds but the reverse; faster upload speeds. The more people that are directed to this guide and follow it properly the faster the swarm will become which means faster download speeds for everyone.\r\n \r\n\r\n****this may not pertain to everyone but when setting up the router I had 3 different settings to choose from for my forwarding service; TCP or UDP or BOTH but when setting the firewall I had to set 2 exceptions 1 for each so I back tracked and setup my router with 2 services as well. Also I found a setting on the WAN settings page for the router to accept ping\'s from the internet....\r\n \r\nThe reason for this when I finished setting the router I downloaded the port checker available at portforward and ran the test but couldn\'t get both TCP and UDP to work and I couldn\'t ping my router.\r\n\r\nYour failure to connect may be due to several reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe my address is blacklisted?\r\n\r\nThe site blocks addresses listed in the (former) PeerGuardian database, as well as addresses of banned users. This works at Apache/PHP level, it\'s just a script that blocks logins from those addresses. It should not stop you from reaching the site. In particular it does not block lower level protocols, you should be able to ping/traceroute the server even if your address is blacklisted. If you cannot then the reason for the problem lies elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIf somehow your address is indeed blocked in the PG database do not contact us about it, it is not our policy to open ad hoc exceptions. You should clear your IP with the database maintainers instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour ISP blocks the site\'s address\r\n\r\n(In first place, it\'s unlikely your ISP is doing so. DNS name resolution and/or network problems are the usual culprits.)\r\nThere\'s nothing we can do. You should contact your ISP (or get a new one). Note that you can still visit the site via a proxy, follow the instructions in the relevant section. In this case it doesn\'t matter if the proxy is anonymous or not, or which port it listens to.\r\n\r\nNotice that you will always be listed as an \"unconnectable\" client because the tracker will be unable to check that you\'re capable of accepting incoming connections.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternate port (81)\r\n\r\nSome of our torrents use ports other than the usual HTTP port 80. This may cause problems for some users, for instance those behind some firewall or proxy configurations. You can easily solve this by editing the .torrent file yourself with any torrent editor, e.g. MakeTorrent, and replacing the announce url http://torrents.empornium.me:80 with torrents.empornium.me:81 or just torrents.empornium.me.\r\n\r\nEditing the .torrent with Notepad is not recommended. It may look like a text file, but it is in fact a bencoded file. If for some reason you must use a plain text editor, change the announce url to torrents.empornium.me:81, not torrents.empornium.me. (If you\'re thinking about changing the number before the announce url instead, you know too much to be reading this.)[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting your connection.[spoiler= ]\r\nIf you are having problems connecting,  please try the following steps one at a time and then attempt to connect again,  as each step has the potential of solving the connection issue.\r\n\r\nFirst of all: Make sure you aren\'t using a bad client.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Refresh your connection\r\n\r\nRenewing your IP address and flushing your DNS cache  can often help resolve connection issues.\r\n\r\nFor Windows:\r\n\r\n    Click Start then Run\r\n    Type cmd in the run box and press Enter (a Command Console window should appear)\r\n    In the Command Console window, type ipconfig /release and press Enter \r\n    Wait for a few seconds for a reply that the IP address has been released\r\n    In the Command Console window, type ipconfig /renew and press Enter\r\n    Wait for a few seconds for a reply that the IP address has been re-established\r\n    In the Command Console window, type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter\r\n    Close the Command Console window and attempt to play the game\r\n\r\nIf you are using Windows Vista or 7, you will need to load the Command Console differently:\r\n\r\n    Go to Start, then Programs, then Accessories and locate Command Prompt\r\n    Right-click on Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator from the drop down menu\r\n    Now continue from Step 3 of the Windows instructions above\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Macintosh Apple OS-X:\r\n\r\n    Click Apple, then System Preferences, then Network and finally Network Status\r\n    Select Built-in Ethernet from the Network Status menu and click Configure\r\n    Click Renew DHCP Lease (this process may take a few minutes)\r\n    Close the Network Status window\r\n    Open the Terminal\r\n\r\n    If using Mac OS X 10.5.8 or 10.6.x, type dscacheutil -flushcache\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Resetting your modem and/or router\r\n\r\nIf the connection difficulties persist, please Power Cycle your modem and router to reset them and allow them to re-establish a connection to your ISP. \r\nPlease follow these steps to completely power cycle the devices in your network connection:\r\n\r\n    Shut down all computers connected to the modem/router\r\n    Power down/unplug the router if you use one\r\n    Power down/unplug the modem\r\n    Allow to sit for 60 seconds, unplugged\r\n    Turn on the modem, allow to completely boot up till the front panel connection lights show a steady connection\r\n    Turn on the router, if you have one, and allow to completely boot up as well\r\n    Start the computer and allow to completely boot up\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Check that there are no issues with the tracker\r\n\r\nCheck the forums, if there are any known issues with the tracker, you can often find more information there.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Firewalls, routers, and internet connection sharing\r\n\r\nWhatever client you\'re using, find out what listening port you\'re client is using and visit http://portforward.com/\r\nand make sure your home network is forwarding ports correctly from your router to your computer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour firewall can block ports - try disabling your own firewall  and using the windows firewall to test whether or not this is the problem\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are using any type of firewall, router, or you are sharing your internet connection between multiple computers, you may need to set your system up to allow access to the tracker.\r\n\r\nThe firewall or router will need to allow unrestricted communication on TCP ports 6881-6889. You may find assistance in configuring your firewall and/or router in Brian\'s BitTorrent FAQ and Guide http://btfaq.com/serve/cache\r\n\r\nIf possible, try uninstalling any firewall applications on your computer, and physically removing the router from your internet connection (by having your computer connect directly to your modem). This will allow you to identify whether the firewall or router is responsible for the connection problem. If this turns out to be the case, please consult the documentation that came with that networking product, or contact the manufacturer for further assistance setting it up properly.\r\n\r\n5. Check for updates\r\n\r\nOut-of-date drivers or operating system files can cause connection issues. Please check for the following updates:\r\n\r\nOperating System Updates:\r\n\r\n    Be sure that you have the latest updates for your operating system.   Windows updates are available at http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com\r\n\r\n    Mac OS X updates can be obtained by clicking on the Apple icon  and choosing Software Update...\r\n\r\n\r\nBroadband users:\r\n\r\nThere are several drivers that, if out-of-date, could cause issues for broadband users. If you need more help in locating drivers for your hardware, please contact the hardware manufacturer or a qualified technician. If you access the internet through an external broadband modem, be sure you have the latest firmware and drivers available for your modem. If your computer connects to the modem via USB, be sure you have the latest drivers for your motherboard or your USB PCI card.

There\'s no point in posting just to be sent back here.\r\n\r\nBefore posting read the sticky topics (the ones at the top). Many times new information that still hasn\'t been incorporated in the FAQ can be found there.\r\n\r\nHelp us in helping you. Do not just say \'it doesn\'t work!\'.\r\n\r\nProvide details so that we don\'t have to guess or waste time asking. What client do you use? What\'s your OS? What\'s your network setup? What\'s the exact error message you get, if any? What are the torrents you are having problems with?\r\n\r\nThe more you tell the easier it will be for us, and the more probable your post will get a reply. And needless to say: be polite.

GUIDE[/font][/size][/color][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOk we get a lot of questions about the best seedbox out there etc.  So i decided to write a guide on how to setup a [color=blue][url=http://www.kimsufi.com/fr/]Kimsufi 2G[/url][/color] as a seedbox.\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]Sections of the guide[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\n- [url=#where]What site should i order my Kimsufi 2G

twice as much for the Server to avoid Linux[/url]\r\n\r\n[size=4][u][b]I recommend[/b][/u][/size]\r\n\r\nIf your brave i highly recommend the use of Deluge with a Remote GUI on your desktop.  The Kimsufi 2G is far from the most powerful Server in the world. Not using the Remote Desktop and doing things from a distance via Deluge is by far the least CPU and RAM intensive option.  When your moving a lot of data this could quite possibly translate to greater upload and download speeds.  Especially with a lot of torrents.\r\n\r\n[#=where][size=4][b][u]Which site should i order from in my Country[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.com/fr/]Main Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (Unlimited Transfers)\r\nAndorra\r\nAnonymous (your ordering under a false ID so go for Unlimited)\r\nAustralia\r\nBelgium\r\nFrance\r\nFrench Guyana\r\nFrench Polynesia\r\nFrench South Territories\r\nGuadeloupe\r\nLuxembourg\r\nMartinique\r\nMonaco\r\nNew Caledonia\r\nRÃ©union\r\nSt Pierre and Miquelon\r\nSwitzerland\r\nWallis and Futuna\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.ie/]Ireland Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nCanada\r\nRepublic of Ireland\r\nUnited States of America\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.co.uk/]UK Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.isgenug.de/]German Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nAustria\r\nGermany\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.isgenoeg.nl/]Netherlands Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nNetherlands\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kemsirve.es/]Spain Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nArgentina\r\nBolivia\r\nChile\r\nColombia\r\nCosta Rica\r\nDominican republic\r\nEcuador\r\nEl Salvador\r\nGuatemala\r\nHonduras\r\nMexico\r\nNicaragua\r\nPanama\r\nParaguay\r\nPeru\r\nSpain\r\nUruguay\r\nVenezuela\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.pl/]Poland Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nPoland\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.it/]Italy Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nItaly\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kemeda.pt/]Portugal Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nBrazil\r\nPortugal\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.cz/]Czech Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nCzech Republic\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.lt/]Lithuania Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nLithuania\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.fi/]Finland Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nFinland\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.sn/]Senegal Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nSenegal\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.com/tn/]Tunisia Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nTunisia\r\n\r\n[url=http://www.kimsufi.com/ma/]Morocco Kimsufi/OVH[/url] (5TB per month then shaped to 10Mbps)\r\nMorocco\r\n\r\n[color=red]If people are aware of countries and who they are supposed to order through please inform me and i will add them to the list\r\nAlso regarding the 5TB limit if anyone orders from some of these alternatives can they please check their manager and tell me if it lists a limit.  I have more than a sneaking suspicion that this 5TB limit is just a copy over from an old version of the OVH site and doesnt in fact exist anymore but as i order from OVH direct i cant confirm this. If you can confirm or deny the 5TB limit i would love to know[/color]\r\n\r\nIf the 5TB limit really worries you there may be ways to get around the default country but they are not easy and likely against the terms of service.  I will leave you to imagine them yourself.\r\n\r\nOVH will most likely ask you to verify your identity.  They will want a copy of your Drivers Licence/Passport, A Utility Bill and a copy of your CC with all except the last 4 numbers obscured.  Again i will leave you to decide if you can handle this or wish to take other measures that i will not provide advice on.\r\n\r\n[#=why][size=4][b][u]Why should i choose a Kimsufi 2G over other seedboxes?[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n- Its not really just a seedbox its actually a dedicated server so you have a lot more options than your usually seedbox slot.\r\n\r\n- For the price of a small seedbox slot you get 1TB of storage and unlimited torrents not to mention the whole 100Mbps link all to yourself.\r\n\r\n- If your able to order direct to from OVH in France you also get Unlimited transfers. Most of the country specific sites suggest they limit the 2G to 5TB and once you pass that reduce speed for the rest of the month to 10Mbps.  Its country dependant sorry and im slowly compiling a list. Im also looking into if this limit in fact really exists.\r\n\r\nBut if your doing over 5TB a month is that really such a hardship? \r\n\r\n- Most Seedbox slots are actually a shared Kimsufi 2G or Kimsufi 16G so why not have the whole box for the same price or less?\r\n\r\n- The option to use a GUI rather than CLI if you so desire (i will cover both options)\r\n\r\n- Choice of Torrent client ( i will cover both KTorrent for those who must use a GUI and Deluge with remote GUI for those a little more comfortable with the CLI)\r\n\r\n[color=red][b]A final note. Please do not post this guide on other sites.  At least not until its finished and tested and not without asking me. Its been a lot of work converting my knowledge and what others have taught me into a simple guide and im fairly certainly even once done i will spend some time solving problems and modifying it.  So i dont want it posted everywhere unless its working properly please.[/b][/color]\r\n\r\n[#=order][size=4][b][u]The Ordering Process[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\nGo to Kimsufi.com (its in French so i recommend Google Chrome for automatic translation or Firefox with the appropriate plugin).  Once you have finished the setup process all contact and the server will be in the language of your choice :)\r\n\r\nOnce translated it should look like this\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=D026_4FE84012][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=D026_4FE84012&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nClick the Commander button for the server of your choice the Kimsufi 2G.  Although this guide will work just as well for any of the Kimsufi range.\r\n\r\nChoose your set-up method.  In this case you want to choose \"Bureau distant\" or Remote Desktop.  I will use this for both methods.  Having the Remote desktop available is nice and costs nothing so why lock yourself into CLI only?\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=B662_4FE842B3][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=B662_4FE842B3&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nNext step is choose which one.  \r\n\r\nChange it to your desired language and choose Ubuntu Desktop 12.04 for the reason its 64 bit out of the box (very important if you choose anything larger than the 2G) and its also the most current Long Term Support Version of Ubuntu.\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=64E2_4FE84444][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=64E2_4FE84444&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nAfter this you should get this page.\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=7297_4FE86EB3][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=7297_4FE86EB3&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nI then recommend you change the lease term to 1 month as you can always renew later with ease and you might end up with a Celeron rather than an Atom processor.  The Atom is much better if you can get it.  \r\n\r\nHeck you may not even want the box long term.  A month or two with this baby may very well solve you ratio issues on multiple sites for months or years.\r\n\r\nOnce done it should now look like this\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=830E_4FE86EB3][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=830E_4FE86EB3&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nClick Continuer and you should now see this\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=B75B_4FE84653][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=B75B_4FE84653&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nClick \"New contract\" and it should extend the page asking for more details like this.\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=F6DB_4FE8474F][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=F6DB_4FE8474F&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nFill it out as your paranoia permits :)  Once done you should get this\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=A1CA_4FE847B7][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=A1CA_4FE847B7&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nChoose a password for your management console and continue.\r\n\r\nIt will now confirm the contact information (that may very well be garbage other than the email address).  Continue\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=9FE3_4FE84910][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=9FE3_4FE84910&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nIt will then do the usual contract confirm tickbox show here.  We all know you will read this carefully and never do anything naughty with this Dedicated server.\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=3FBD_4FE8496F][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=3FBD_4FE8496F&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nNow your at the final confirm and choose payment screen.  I think you can handle the payment yourself :)\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=D5FF_4FE849C9][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=D5FF_4FE849C9&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\nYou have now ordered a Kimsufi 2G so wait on the emails and prepare to set it up.\r\n\r\nOnce the server is setup you should get an email like this that will contain your login details\r\n\r\n[url=http://xxx.freeimage.us/share.php?id=B4E9_4FEC4BBE][img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=B4E9_4FEC4BBE&jpg[/img][/url]\r\n\r\n[#=x2go][/#][size=4][b][u]Installing the X2Go Client on your home machine[/u][/b][/size]\r\n\r\n- Windows\r\n\r\nThe files can be found here and need Admin rights\r\n\r\n[url=http://anonym.to/?http://code.x2go.org/releases/binary-win32/x2goclient]X2Go Client for Windows[/url]\r\n\r\n- Ubuntu (also likely other versions of Linux)\r\n\r\nCheck your package manager.

Then just get the bare minimum option like the one above and 64bit unless for some reason you prefer 32bit that is available too, cheapest option unless you plan to do more than seedbox.\r\n\r\n4. Once you get it set up you will get a Windows Remote Desktop Access so is like being there.\r\n\r\n5. Install Firefox unless you prefer IE (yuck and unsafe) with Adblock Plus and NoScript for safety.\r\n\r\n6. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO STAY SAFE AS THIS IS A SERVER OPEN TO THE WORLD AND WILL BE ATTACKED.\r\n\r\n7. Configure the Windows Firewall to open ports for FTP (DO NOT USE THE STANDARD 21 ONE BUT SOMETHING ELSE like for example 2348 again for safety) and uTorrent.\r\n\r\n8. Install Windows Defender for Virus protection. Others will not work on a Server installation. But this one is fine in my experience.\r\n\r\n9. Install and configure FileZilla Server (this one again is safe in my experience) and again for safety only allow writing when you need it. Then turn it off again.\r\n\r\n10. Install uTorrent configure, create folders etc...\r\n\r\n11. Personally I run torrents in an encrypted partition (there are several free softwares to do this) that I mount manually each time.

I tweeked a few things and a few lines to make it easier to read because it is a LOT to read.\r\n\r\n[b]First of all don\'t assume you are connectable.[/b]\r\n \r\nMany people assume they are connectable, because they are successfully torrenting. That however is not always the case.\r\n\r\n[b]How do i know if i am connectable or not?[/b]\r\n\r\nUse the [color=blue][u][url=/user.php?action=connchecker]Conn-Checker[/url][/u][/color].\r\n\r\nThe Connectability Checker is used to check you are connectable through your torrent client.\r\n\r\nYou must enter your external IP address and the port you are [b]currently connected[/b] on with your torrent client.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of this article you can find some graphical help in determining what port you have set in your torrent client.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]What does it mean to be connectable?[/b]\r\n \r\nBeing connectable means other peers in the swarm can make connections to you, you can make connections to other peers without being connectable your self, if the other peers in your swarm are good enough torrent citizens to be connectable.\r\n \r\n\r\n[b]Why does it matter?[/b]\r\n \r\nWell, Many private trackers restrict people who aren\'t connectable, and even on some sites no seed bonuses are credited to people who aren\'t. most importantly people who aren\'t connectable hurt the swarm. Each peer that isn\'t connectable is limited to sharing with only peers who are connectable. If the number of peers who aren\'t connectable is low the result is unnoticeable, But the higher the percentage goes the slower the swarm becomes until it dies at the point when all peers are unconnectable. There\'s no one left to connect to.\r\n \r\n\r\n[b]Why am I unconnectable? Well maybe...[/b]\r\n \r\n[*]Lack of proper port forwarding.\r\n[*]TURN OFF DHT, PEER EXCHANGE, LOCAL PEER DISCOVERY\r\n[*]Bandwidth oversaturation, incoming or outgoing.\r\n[*]Too many torrents started at once.\r\n[*]Too many connections per torrent, or total.\r\n[*]ISP blocking chosen port\r\n[*]Router not P2P friendly\r\n[*]ISP modem contains router features\r\n[*]ISP proxying or firewalling your connection\r\n \r\n\r\n[b]What can I do about it?[/b]\r\n \r\nSometimes nothing. for instance if your ISP has you behind a proxy server that blocks incoming requests. If their only blocking certain ports you can change the port you use, and if their throttling (this has nothing to do with becoming connectable.) you could use uTorrent or \r\nAzureus and enable encryption. It may be that you are trying to torrent from a place of business with routers, proxy servers, firewalls, and/or traffic shaping software, or appliances like websense. If your even lucky enough to get a torrent running at all, but being connectable is out of the question.However, most cases being connectable is fun, easy and can be done without spending any money at all.\r\n \r\n\r\n[*][b]First[/b], make sure any anti-virus software you use isn\'t blocking any ports you use for torrenting \r\n[*][b]Second[/b], set your firewall to give full access to your torrent program, don\'t block it in any way. \r\n[*][b]Third[/b], set your bandwidth limits in your torrent software, if you let it use all your bandwidth to share information with your peers there may not be enough to browse the internet or communicate with the tracker. Not being able to communicate with the tracker in a timely fashion may cause the tracker to list you as unconnectable when you are in fact connectable. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net - The Global Broadband Speed Test to find your up and down speeds, set your client for around 80% outgoing and 90% to 95% incoming. These numbers aren\'t set in stone so feel free to play a little but make sure you are connectable first and be prepared to change them back if you run into problems. \r\n[*][b]Fourth[/b], Don\'t shutdown or start your software with a lot of torrents running. whats a lot? I think 3 would be OK, but 10 is out. The point is shut down and start your torrents individually or groups of 2 or 3 with a pause between, and if you shutdown your computer wait for your start up programs to finish before starting your torrents back up. \r\n[*][b]Fifth[/b], limit the number of connections per torrent and total connections. defaults will usually work but maybe shrink it down more if your still showing up unconnectable. \r\n[*][b]Sixth[/b], make sure your modem doesnt have routing features. Some newer modems have features but are not heavily configurable so the easiest thing to do is to turn these features off if possable. \r\n[*][b]Seventh[/b], Your router may just not be good at handling P2P protocalls like bitorrent which require many connections made over a short time. All routers have a limited number of connections they can handle being open at any one time, some leave connections open for too long, most notably LINKSYS WRT54G/GL/GS routers. There are fixes for this but it involves upgrading to beta or possibly third-party firmware, which always carries risks. If you think this applies to you follow the faq on uTorrent\'s or whatever client you are using site but proceed with the utmost caution.\r\n[*][b]Eighth[/b], Try using ports between 65,000 and 65,500 this works better for most people, and do not use software like PeerGuardian2. TURN OFF DHT, PEER EXCHANGE, and LOCAL PEER DISCOVERY\r\n[*][b]Finally[/b], and this can be the hardest part for most people, follow one of many very good guides concerning port forwarding.Port Forwarding Guides Listed by Manufacturer and Model - PortForward.com is a good place to start.\r\n \r\n1. Setup your computer to a static ip there are very good guides for this at portforward select your operating system and follow the guide.\r\n \r\n2. Next you need to setup your router to forward the correct ports to your computer. A step by step guide for just about every router is located at PortForward\'s Other Guides - PortForward.com , scroll down and select port forwarding guides by router. Just select your router, and \r\nthen click on your bit-torrent client for specific steps on how to correctly configure your setup. Remember to use the IP address you assigned your computer in step one. Also, the port number can be almost anything you want, but I suggest using something over 50,000. \r\n\r\n3. If you run a firewall you\'ll need to set it up to allow the correct traffic. go to Port Forwarding Guides Listed by Manufacturer and Model - PortForward.com select the firewall you have and follow the steps.\r\n \r\n4. Once you\'ve set up all of that, make sure your client is running, then go to Open Port Check Tool\r\nenter in the port you\'re using.This page will tell you whether your port is open, stealthed, or closed.If it is open, then you should be Connectable.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[b]Why have your computer set to a static IP?[/b]\r\n \r\nOn networks where DCHP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is running you get an IP address issued automatically when you connect.In theory this is great but until you connect you donâ€™t know what this IP address will be. Most routers have a set range of IP addresses to use \r\nbut how these are issued depends on the make/model of the router.So if you set up port forwarding for the IP currently issued to your PC today, will it work tomorrow or even after a reboot? Maybe but if the PC gets issued a different IP address your PC will never see the data on the ports you forwarded.How can you be sure of always having the port forwarded to the right computer port â€“ simple set up a static IP address. That way every timethe computer restarts it will be the same IP address and the port forwarding will work perfectly.\r\n \r\n\r\n[b]Why be connectable (or what happens when you are not?)[/b]\r\n \r\nA 1gig torrent is uploaded. The uploader starts seeding. 9 leechers jump on to the torrent. The torrent is going very slow. He has already seeded 5GB but no one has completed. Turns out they are all unconnectable. This means that the uploader needs to send 1gig of data to each of them. If he stops seeding before they have completed the torrent it will dry up and no more data will be transferred.\r\n \r\n\r\n[b]Another example:[/b]\r\n\r\nYou find the torrent. There\'s 10 seeders. You\'re hopeful for good speeds. Your PC starts looking for bits. The speed is slow and you only seem to be connecting to 1 seeder.... WTH!!! Well if 9 are not connectable this means you\'ll not be able to leech very much from them and at very slow speeds. \r\n\r\nThe essence of this guide is not to get you individually faster download speeds but the reverse; faster upload speeds.

How to register your nickname on IRC','Guide on how to register your nickname on the Empornium IRC Network','[align=center][b][size=2]How to Register your nickname on IRC[/size][/b][/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistering your nickname on Empornium IRC provides a number of benefits. The most notable of these is that registering your nickname prevents other people from using it. Once a user starts using the nickname, they will be asked to â€˜identifyâ€™ to it with a password. If they fail to do so, their nickname will be changed. This helps to stop people posing as you.\r\n\r\nOnce you register your nickname, you can be added to the auto voice and op lists in other peopleâ€™s channels. This enables you to be a permanent staff member in channels. You are also entitled to a vhost once you have been registered.\r\n\r\nRegistration provides you with many benefits and is completely free.\r\n\r\nTo register your nickname on Empornium IRC, you must first be using it. If you are not currently using it, change to it with the command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/nick <nickname>[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[quote]/nick CrazyUser[/quote]\r\n\r\nOnce you are using the nickname, you may register it in one of two ways. In any client, use the following command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns register <password> <e-mail>[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns register supersecretpassword crazyuser@hotmail.com[/quote]\r\n\r\nFollowing this, you will be not get an e-mail you are done. The e-mail is needed only to recover your password.\r\n\r\nEach time you connect and start using the registered, you will be told that â€œThis nick is owned by someone elseâ€. You must â€˜identifyâ€™ to it using the following command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns identify <password>[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns identify supersecretpassword[/quote]\r\n\r\nIf you use mIRC, you can load the following script into the Remotes section of your script editor (press alt+R to access this) to identify you automatically. Just replace â€˜YOURPASSWORDHEREâ€™ with your actual password:\r\n\r\non 1:NOTICE:*This nickname is registered and protected*:?: {\r\n   if ($nick == NickServ) {\r\n      ns identify YOURPASSWORDHERE\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\non 1:NOTICE:*This nick is owned by someone else*:?: {\r\n   if ($nick == NickServ) {\r\n      ns identify YOURPASSWORDHERE\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIf you require help, come and see us in [url=http://torrents.empornium.me/irc.php]#empornium-help on irc.emprn.tk[/url]. Users who have registered with NickServ will automatically get voiced in the channel when they join.','2012-09-10 17:48:20'),(51,1,4,'irc_multi_nick',0,'04. Grouping Nicknames together on IRC.','Useful if you want to connect from more than one computer at a time.','[align=center][b][size=2]Grouping nicknames together on IRC[/size][/b][/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo youâ€™ve registered your nick, but have more than one computer/device that you join IRC from. You might be wondering â€œdo I need to register a new nick and have people add that nick to access lists as well? Certainly there must be an easier way.â€\r\n\r\nWell luckily for you, there is. You are able to group nicks together so that permissions and other data are shared among accounts. Some of the items that are shared include (but are not limited to): channel ownership, permission levels (owner, halfop, etc.) on channels, group info that was provided when you registered, password, and virtual host. Pretty much anything your single nick has associated with it will be associated with the group of nicks that you have registered.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s how to group a nick to one that you already have registered:\r\n\r\n* Switch to the nick that you want to group\r\n[quote]/nick JayneCobb[/quote]\r\n\r\n* Enter the following command in the server/status window: \r\n[quote]/msg nickserv group [/quote] \r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Example:[/b] \r\nI want to group JayneCobb to my primary nick, MalcolmReynolds. I would type the following:\r\n[quote]/nick JayneCobb\r\n/msg nickserv group[/quote]\r\nNote: you must be identified as MalcomeReynolds when you changed your nickname.\r\n\r\nLook for nickserv to either tell you that you have joined the group of your primay nick or give you an error message.\r\n\r\nAnd just to give you the commands again, they are, in order:\r\n\r\n[quote]/nick theNewNick[/quote]\r\n[quote]/msg nickserv group main_nick password[/quote]\r\n\r\nNow what if you want to delink a nick, i.e. remove it from the group, is there some way to do that? Yes there is, you just ungrouop it by switching to the nick, and doing \r\n[quote]/msg nickserv ungrouop [/quote]\r\nDoing that will make nickserv completely drop the nick â€“ it will no longer exist, have any permissions, etc.\r\n\r\nIs there someway to delink it without ungrouping, or without it losing the permissions and other information? Not currently, although I suppose it is possible that it could end up in a future version of services, or someone could create a module that could drop a nick and register it using the credentials of the former group and preserving permissions, etc.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions about grouping nicks, feel free to leave a comment here, or to join #empornium-help and ask in there.','2012-10-22 16:36:31'),(52,1,4,'irc_auto_join',0,'05. Add IRC Channels to automatically join','Add a list of channels to join when you connect to IRC and identify.','[align=center][b][size=2]Add IRC channels to automatically join[/size][/b][/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe AJOIN command is a server-side command that keeps track of the channels you join each time you connect to Empornium IRC. If you login with your nick and identify with your password, you can join all the same channels automatically. It works no matter what client you use or where you connect from since all the details are kept on the server.\r\n\r\n* Note that your client may have an option to keep an auto-join locally.

Join all the channels you want to add, and use the command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns AJOIN ADDALL[/quote]\r\n\r\nThe command will also automatically include the keys for any channels to your AJOIN list.\r\n\r\n[u][b]How do I see a list of all the channels I join automatically?[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nTo see a list of all the channels on your AJOIN list, use the command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns AJOIN LIST[/quote]\r\n\r\nUse wild cards with this command to list only the channels on your AJOIN list that match a specific pattern. \r\nFor instance, the command [quote]/ns AJOIN LIST #top*[/quote] would return all the channels on your AJOIN list that begin with â€œ#topâ€ (for instance, #topgear).\r\n\r\n[u][b]How do I remove a channel from my AJOIN list?[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nTo remove a channel from your AJOIN list, use the command\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns AJOIN DEL #channel[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor instance, [quote]/ns AJOIN DEL #topgear[/quote] would remove the channel #topgear from your AJOIN list.\r\n\r\n[u][b]How do I delete all the channels that I join automatically?[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nTo remove all the channels from your AJOIN list, use this command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/msg NickServ AJOIN CLEAR[/quote]\r\n\r\nThe command will delete all the channels from your AJOIN list.

The site had to pick one, that is the one we picked. \r\n    - Never add tags that are not actually a part of the clip. i.e: not.pregnant, this is a useless tag.\r\n    - Do not double up, i.e: as per rules page, do not use big.tits and big.boobs and big.knockers. Just use big.tits as it is the official tag for that specific \'bent\'. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Background[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nA lot of effort and discussion has gone into the subject of tags. Some love them, some hate them. In the end Sys Ops and Admin have elected to implement the use of tags on Empornium, but in doing so the system has been refined in an effort to make them more useful. The system implemented is \'Community Tagging\'. However, like all tagging systems this wont work without all members assistance.\r\n\r\nTags were a favourite among many of the old Cheggit members BUT, those members will notice the tag system employed here is slightly different to Cheggits. As the name implies, Community Tagging has more direct member input, and there is an expectation by Empornium on its members to use them correctly. Empornium also employs a traditional [url=http://empornium.mooo.com/articles.php?topic=search]Torrent Search[/url] system too, and even that one is more advanced. \r\n\r\nThe end result is we get the best of both worlds and then some. The opportunity to use each of the search functions in concert with each other is a major bonus and can help to refine a search much more narrowly. But this can only work if all members understand the concepts and use them in a manner that is intended. So remember that, our use of the Community Tag system can be a great benefit, or an abject failure, and that depends entirely on us ...the members.\r\n\r\nWhile tags are not a mandatory aspect of a torrent, they are implemented so it makes sense to make use of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Tag Tools[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nTo make scanning the tags of a particular torrent easier, the heading \'Tags\' on each torrent page is a toggle switch, and if clicked will switch the sorting method from \'vote count\' to \'alphabetical\'.\r\n\r\nBe aware of the [url=http://empornium.mooo.com/articles.php?topic=tag]Tagging Rules[/url]\r\n\r\nMake yourself familiar with the [url=http://empornium.mooo.com/torrents.php?action=tag_synonyms]Official Tag List[/url]\r\n\r\nThe site is geared to recognise a synonym. That is if a member doing a search enters a common alternative to an official tag, the synonym system will offer them results with the official tag. So dont worry about all the alternatives.\r\n\r\nOn each torrent upload page, there is a drop down menu for official tags. There is no need to remember them all, or to keep switching between pages to use them. The drop down menu will list all official tags and you simply select the appropriate ones and they are added to your torrent. Easy.\r\n\r\nTag voting (+) or (-) and Tag adding. See the section below on \'Community Tagging\'\r\n\r\nTags Glossary, a list of possible tags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]So what is a Tag?[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nA tag is a word or group of words that can be searched on in order to help users find content. It is not a title, or a description, it is a single word or a group of words joined by a period (\'.\') to assist in searches. i.e: small.tits or \'ebony\' etc. Its more inclusive and expansive than simple category systems which limited you to one category. The category system is also used here, tags are a supplement to that system. They are a method of informing people and the search system of each uploads unique aspects or \'kinks\'. What makes the clip unique or distinguishes it from the thousands of other uploads that also fit in the same category. You can add the single category, plus the aspects that individualise the clips you\'re uploading.\r\n\r\nExample, if a clip has an ebony lady with small tits you could tag it with, \'ebony small.tits\' (minus the quotes). Between individual tags there is a space, and a \'.\' (period) is used to join words that are part of an individual tag. small.tits big.cock big.tits etc.\r\n\r\nAnother example expanding on the ebony clip mentioned. \r\n - A clip may include a woman with small tits and a dude with a big cock, doing anal sex finishing with a facial. \r\n - The title may be, \'Halle Does Barry\', \r\n - Its category might be hardcore and \r\n - Its description may say \'Halle meets Barry for lunch, she gets more than she bargained for when Barry goes to town on her, and she loves every minute of it.\' \r\n\r\nThe limitation of that description is that it does not include the term small tits despite (at least one of) the actresses having small tits, and it may or may not have \'anal\', big cock\' or \'facial\' included in the description either. As a consequence, using the traditional search system that torrent would fail to appear in the results for ebony, anal, big cock, small tits or facial. It will only show up searching for things in the category, description or title. And many find typing full descriptions tiresome already. With the tags system this torrent could be uploaded as per the description already given, plus tagged with; anal big.cock small.tits facial ebony and any other specific aspect as well. However, these are not a substitute for a description, a reasonable description must still be supplied.\r\n\r\nWith those \'Tags\', if a member has a preference for ebony, small tits, big cocks, facials or anal, they could simply search using the tag \'small.tits\' ((without quote marks) or one or more of the other tags) and they should get a list of clips from all genres where at least one actress has small tits. (or whatever tag(s) they choose to search for).\r\n\r\nNow if you think about it, this can be beneficial as there are many \'indulgences\' or \'kinks\' that would rarely or at least not always form part of a description or title. Tags can help us find our particular \'bent\'. This is what is meant by unique.\r\n\r\nSo I hear you asking what if I tag my torrent correctly but members doing searches enter an alternative, wont they miss my torrent? i.e: big.tits, v big.knockers. You\'re partially right, we dont all call them the same thing. BUT we have it covered, just stick to the official tags. If a member enters big.knockers into the system on search, the synonym feature of the system will show them results for big.tits. You wont miss out on any hits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Community Tagging[/b][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=2][b]Voting and Adding Tags[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nWhen an uploader adds tags when making the torrent, they are given a count of 8, plus 1 for the uploaders vote. The idea is that 8 is a basis to help keep tags long enough for members to agree on them, and the uploader has no need to vote for tags they already added. However, if you prefer, this can be switched off in your settings. The tag will be added with just the 8 base votes.\r\n\r\nWhen a tag is added by members it is given a base count of 3 plus the one for the member that added it. So it will appear with 4, or 3 depending on your settings.\r\n\r\nFor the moment at least, interacting with other peoples tags is limited to those members with a status above \'Apprentice\'. We apologise to those who do not yet qualify, but that is necessary to limit the potential problems that can arise from inexperienced members. Of course an Apprentice can add tags to their own torrents during the upload.\r\n\r\n- If a tag is missing from someones torrent, and you KNOW it should be there then by all means add it. Theres no need to post in the comments section requesting the uploader or a mod to add it. All members above Apprentice can add tags to any torrent.\r\n\r\n- As the [url=http://empornium.mooo.com/articles.php?topic=tag]Tagging Rules[/url] state, members can vote a tag up, or down. If you agree that a tag is perfectly appropriate for the given torrent, then vote it up by clicking the (+) next to the relevant tag. If you believe in all fairness that the tag is wrong or misleading, then vote it down (-) next to the relevant tag.\r\n\r\n- Your vote is only counted once. But if you make a mistake on your vote, then you can correct it. Just click the opposite action and it will return to the state it was prior to the error. You can then click it again and apply your actual vote.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of Emporniums tagging system is important as it helps to limit the false positives when uploaders use useless or inappropriate tags, and it helps people find things when the uploader completely leaves them out. There are [url=http://empornium.mooo.com/articles.php?topic=tag]Tagging Rules[/url] regarding tags, so if you tag for hits, then you do so at your own risk. \r\n\r\nThe vote system also helps when the inevitable difference of opinion occurs. Not everyone considers tits for example in the same way. One persons small.tits will not qualify as small to another. The vote system allows for that difference based on a site wide attitude. It may not in the end reflect your own, or my, opinion, but it will be a site-wide consensus if we participate.\r\n\r\nAs per the rules, make sure your vote reflects the tag itself in relation to the content. Its pointless and damaging to the effectiveness of the system to vote a tag up just because the words give you a boner/hard nipple, and conversely pointless and damaging to vote down those that you find displeasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]So how can I as a member help?[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nBy all means, add tags, vote on tags. It is this participation that will make tags much more effective than simply leaving it up to the uploader alone. Voting and adding where appropriate is encouraged.\r\n\r\nTags serve two main purposes, searching for what you want and filtering out what you don\'t want. For this reason if you\'re going to add tags, or vote on them, it is important that you be as thorough as possible in your thinking. Try to think beyond the details that are important to you, and include the details that anyone else could possibly be interested in. There are tags that you care about that others don\'t, and tags others care about that you don\'t.\r\n\r\nFor, example you may have no interest in whether someone has bare feet or is wearing shoes. But there are people who only want to see one and not the other. Some people care about dialog more than sexual positions and others don\'t care about dialog at all but really care what specific sex acts are performed.\r\n\r\nFor tags to be as effective as possible, sometimes it is also important to tag the common as well as the unique. For example, you might think it\'s unimportant to tag big.cock because most male pornstars have big cocks and 99% of the videos meet this criteria. But suppose someone is looking for only videos with gay Asian men with big cocks. Without the big.cock tag that might be difficult to search for. Using those tags, the search becomes much more refined.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of tags, tag search and the cloud relies on consistent tagging by everyone. Avoid essentially useless tags such as \r\n - ass, \r\n - boobs, \r\n - fuck, \r\n - sex, \r\n - hot.\r\nThese do not make useful search terms. These are useless tags.\r\n\r\nIn general every body part tag needs to have a qualifying adjective to be useful:  \r\n - small.ass\r\n - big.ass\r\n - small.tits,\r\n - big.tits\r\n - big.cock, \r\n - blue.eyes, \r\n - long.hair,\r\n - blonde.hair\r\n\r\nSame for acts:\r\n - slow.fuck\r\n - anal.sex\r\n\r\nThese things might make useful search terms to some members, and as such will help your torrent get more hits.\r\n\r\nHot? Its just an opinion. hot.ass is no better. It might be part of your description if you like, but shouldnt be a tag.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Creating Tags[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nIf it fits in with an official tag, you would be better off using that tag. You will get more hits that way and wont break the effectiveness of the tagging system.\r\n\r\nA list of suggestions and their explanation can be found in the Tags Glossary.\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=2][b]Allowable characters[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nLetters a-z\r\nNumbers 0-9\r\nPeriod (.) (used to string together multi-word tags (or should that be multi.word?))\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=2][b]Some Tips[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nit is beyond the scope of any tutorial to be exhaustive in creating tags so this is just a guide to give an idea of how its done. All tags created should have reference to all of the above information too. \r\n\r\nCreate a multi-word tag by using the dot as the separator. For example, to tag \"Chicks with Dicks\", the proper 3 word tag would be chicks.with.dicks. When adding tags to your torrents, it is recommended that you start with the more general, then add more specific descriptors.\r\n\r\nTo separate multiple tags you use a space. No commas, just the space.\r\n\r\nchicks.with.dicks big.tits big.cock\r\n\r\nSome ideas for non-official tags could include who\'s in the video, the production house, the country it was made in, the language, year of release. Maybe its where they do it, or how they do it, what they express in the video. Essentially, what makes this video unique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2012-09-28 08:56:28'),(60,1,6,'collagehelp',0,'How to use Collages','A guide to collages of torrents','<< insert guide on what they are for... how permissins work... personal collages for higher ranks etc >>\r\n','2012-08-10 23:03:29'),(61,1,6,'stylesheets',0,'Stylesheets','How to change the site stylesheet (like a skin), or use an external css file','<<insert guide here>>','2012-08-10 23:03:13'),(62,2,1,'connchecker',0,'ConnChecker page content','this content is displayed as a help on the conn-checker page','The Connectability Checker is used to check you are connectable through your torrent client.\r\n\r\nYou must enter your external IP address and the port you are [size=2][color=#FF0000][b]currently connected[/b][/color][/size] on with your torrent client.\r\n\r\n[spoiler=Click to see examples of how to find your port in your torrent client]\r\n[align=center][b]uTorrent[/b]\r\n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-F4B4_50259EFA.jpg[/img]\r\n \r\n[b]Deluge[/b]\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-DED0_507EEDCA.jpg[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n\r\n[color=green][insert images of how to find the port you are using with various torrent clients.]This is work to be done[/color]\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n\r\n(If the Port is already filled in the site has got this info from your recent connection to the tracker - usually this will be correct)\r\n','2012-10-17 19:50:49'),(63,2,1,'tagrulesinline',0,'Tag rules for display on the upload page','basically just the tag rules article without the header','[*]Tags should be separated by a space, and you should use a period (\'.\') to separate words inside a tag - eg.

A vHost (aka virtual host) is a feature on Empornium irc network, that allows you to be identified with a custom host, hiding your real ISP, making some silly joke, or even ban evasion (requesting one for ban evasion will get you banned from the entire network, not just a channel). \r\n\r\n[u][b]Don\'t I already have a vhost?[/b][/u]\r\n\r\nBy default you host is hidden by a standard vhost which everyone who registers gets (e.g. [you].users.SilentZombies ), this tutorial is if you want a custom one. For example MrRandom@Ego.sum.penitus.corrupta\r\n\r\n[u][b]Rules for vhosts[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n1. No IP vhosts, or IP look-a-likes. e.g. SilentZombies-7056744.isp.net or 96226D5B.61EF05EF.4702A4E2.IP\r\n2. If your vhost can, is, or could possibly be an actual domain you need to be able to prove you own that domain. e.g. google.com or empornium.me\r\n3. No impersonating private organizations which have government affiliation (MPAA, RIAA, etc.). We don\'t want any trouble with them ;)\r\n4. No vhosts that contain the words forum, ircop, admin, network, or any IRCop\'s nick. e.g. admin.irc or mrrandom.sucks\r\n5. You are only allowed to change your vhost once every 28 days. Spamming the system with frequent requests will result in a ban from the vhost system.\r\n6. If you are caught abusing vhosts to evade bans, you will have your vhost removed and banned from the network for a minimum of 3 days.\r\n7. No racist words. *Note - What is considered racist/derogatory is subject to discretion by vhost setter.\r\n8. No references to other networks/spamming. (e.g. come.to.irc.blahblahblah.net, join.my.channel)\r\n9. No references to \"kiddy\"-like activity.\r\n10. Your vhost must contain at least one period ([b][size=3].[/size][/b])\r\n11. We do not offer vIdents (the part before tha @ ) but if you use a seperate IRC Client you should be able to change your ident in it\'s settings\r\n\r\n[b][u]How to request a vhost[/u][/b]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo your vhost meets all the rules first you need to be registered with NickServ ([url=http://empornium.mooo.com/articles.php?topic=irc_register_nick]see this tutorial on how to register[/url]). Once that is done simply enter:\r\n[quote]/hs request your.vhost.here[/quote]\r\n\r\nWhen it has been approved it will automatically set its self as your host, and each time you subsequently identify each time you connect.','2012-09-10 18:17:42'),(66,0,1,'UserAgreement',0,'User Agreement','What you agree to when you use torrents.empornium.me','Using this site means you accept its terms.

Furthermore, but not in limitation of the foregoing, you stipulate and agree that the digital modifications, enhancements, and/or restorations of torrents shown on this website which visually distinguish such torrents from the original from which they were derived and/or from other originals or copies thereof are trade secrets of such detail and type that human memory cannot retain or duplicate, and that such modifications, enhancements, and/or restorations are not apparent from inspection of only the modified torrents, so that the human web viewing of such torrents as authorized herein does not make possible disclosure of such trade secret information, and such disclosure requires copying by mechanical, electrical, or digital means or the like which is only authorized by specific permission. Additionally, any information concerning this website or its affiliates or the contributors to this website or their conclusions, views, and/or opinions which is not published on this website is also understood to be proprietary trade secret information and you agree not to disclose any such information which may come into your possession which is not published on this website and to also treat such information as confidential.

You agree not to take any action that will impose a disproportionately large or unreasonable load on our computer web server(s), network, or other infrastructure. Please be mindful of the large amounts of data transfer needed to allow viewing of the torrents.empornium.me web pages with multiple, large torrents, and avoid suddenly flooding the torrents.empornium.me website with large numbers of unanticipated visitors. Suddenly increased, excess web traffic on this website as a result of your actions, including but not limited to publicity, reporting, or recommendations to others regarding this website on network television or radio or national publications or media, of more than one gigabyte of additional Internet data transfer per month, shall be at your expense, and you agree to reimburse torrents.empornium.me for the resulting costs at the rate of the then prevailing additional data transfer charge made by the Internet provider(s) hosting this website.

Caveat lector.\r\n\r\nENTIRE AGREEMENT: You agree that this web page alone constitutes the entire User Agreement, that it is the complete and exclusive statement of your agreement with us, constitutes a writing signed by you, supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties, that no variation of the terms of this User Agreement will be enforceable against us, that it is subject to change which shall be effective immediately, and you waive the right to claim, contest, or assert that this User Agreement was modified, canceled, superseded, or changed by any oral agreement, purchase order, e-mail, notice, or other writing, course of conduct, waiver, implication, or estoppel. This User Agreement shall not be canceled, modified, amended or in any way altered, nor may it be modified by custom and usage of trade or course of dealing. No one has the authority to vary these terms and conditions, and no purported modification by any person, orally or in writing, may be relied upon or deemed binding, and we note our objection thereto, nor shall any writing, undertaking, representation, or warranty made by anyone affiliated with this website which is inconsistent with this User Agreement be binding. Consequently you may not send us your contracts, offers, requirements, forms, purchase orders, files, gift restrictions, confidentiality notices, or other communications containing terms and/or conditions which differ from this User Agreement which if received in violation of the foregoing will be ignored if possible, and will have no effect, but which may if deemed necessary in our sole discretion be subject to legal review at your expense. Our failure to respond or take affirmative action in response to any communication or information sent or provided to us should be understood to mean that we did not receive the communication or information, did not read it, chose not to respond, or disagreed, and should not be construed to indicate our acquiescence, agreement, approval, or consent. Specifically, but not in limitation of the forgoing, this restricted rights website and any related software, data, torrents, or other content are not available for licensing to United States Government End Users or others under the terms of FAR 52.227-19 (\"COMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE RESTRICTED RIGHTS\"), but only under the more restrictive terms as set forth herein.\r\n\r\nUse of a torrents.empornium.me e-mail \"from\" or \"reply-to\" address does not mean that the message came from us and even if authorized does not imply any such authority or affiliation with torrents.empornium.me or this website, nor an ownership or agency relationship, and any claimed authority, title, affiliation, ownership, or relationship by any person or entity not stated on this website shall be conclusively presumed to be invalid and may not be relied upon. Any message received from us whether by fax, e-mail, or other method, including any attachments, contains confidential information intended for a specific individual and purpose and is protected by law. If you are not the intended recipient, please contact the sender immediately by reply e-mail or fax and destroy all copies. You are hereby notified that any disclosure, copying, or distribution of such a message, or the taking of any action based on it, is strictly prohibited. You are warned that computer viruses can be transmitted via e-mail, so the recipient of any e-mail should check it and any attachments for the presence of viruses. (Computer viruses and spammers frequently forge e-mail \"from\" addresses that they copy from infected computers or from the world wide web, so, unfortunately, there are many more unlawful e-mails sent pretending to come from us than e-mails that we actually send.) Even if the e-mail is legitimate, neither we nor the sender accepts liability for any damage caused by any virus transmitted by e-mail. E-mail transmission cannot be guaranteed to be secure or error-free because information could be intercepted, corrupted, lost, destroyed, arrive late or incomplete, or contain viruses. The sender therefore does not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contents of any message or attachment, which arise as a result of e-mail or other electronic transmission.\r\n\r\nThis User Agreement may be assigned by torrents.empornium.me. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to amend, modify, add, remove, or change these terms or portions thereof at any time, without prior notice, and to revoke permission for any cause or for no cause. Any changes become effective immediately upon posting of the revised User Agreement on this website, so please use a notification service and check this website online periodically for such changes. Contractually imposed use restrictions as specified herein may be more restrictive that those of copyright law. Continued use of this website or its contents indicates and shall be deemed to constitute your affirmation of your agreement to this entire User Agreement, including all such restrictions and any changes. To immediately stop using this website and its content is your only remedy should you not agree to any of the terms of this User Agreement, as amended. The terms and conditions of this User Agreement shall apply to all torrents, text, e-mail, webpages, and other content and to all our intellectual property wherever located, including this website, and including copies thereof in whole or part, or derived therefrom, regardless of the form, electronic, printed, or other, whenever or however obtained, including but not limited to when obtained from third parties with or without our permission. This website contains thousands of notices regarding this User Agreement, however, in the event that the language of such notice(s) is inconsistent with the language herein, the language of this User Agreement shall prevail.

A printed version of this User Agreement shall be admissible in arbitration, judicial, or administrative proceedings to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. This User Agreement, and any e-mail, facsimile, or other communications between you and us that is or can be printed by a computer onto paper, whether electronic or on paper, shall be considered to be \"in writing\" and you should print a paper copy of this User Agreement and any such personal electronic communication that is important to you and retain the copy for your records.

References herein to the torrents.empornium.me internet domain shall include any alias or mirror domain names or numbers. Receipt and/or use of any donations shall be governed entirely by this User Agreement and shall not constitute agreement or acceptance of any additional terms and conditions contained therein which shall be null and void. You may not transfer or assign this User Agreement and any such transfer or assignment will be null and void. You further agree to refrain from engaging in any conduct that is, or that we determine to be, in violation of this User Agreement. You acknowledge that remedies at law may be inadequate to protect against breach of our intellectual property rights, as prohibited under this Agreement, and you agree to the granting of injunctive relief without the posting of a bond or undertaking, for the protection of terms laid out in this User Agreement without proof of actual damages. You agree to undertake at your expense any measures and/or legal actions necessary to protect and defend our intellectual property by counsel reasonably accepted by us, and upon request to cooperate with us when we need to do so, and to cooperate with us as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim or in asserting any available defenses. We shall have the right at our sole discretion to assume the exclusive control and defense of any matter.\r\n\r\nNothing in this Agreement shall create any relationship between us, including but not limited to not creating any joint venture, joint employer, franchisee-franchisor, employer-employee, professional-client, organization-member, or principal-agent relationship between you and us, nor impose upon us any obligations for any losses, debts, taxes, or other obligations incurred by you or as a result of your actions. You agree that any time you expend relating to this website is only for your enjoyment and educational purposes and/or your educational hobby or collection and is not labor on behalf of us or our website, and that while you may donate property, including intellectual property (for which gifts we are most grateful!), you may not and agree not to work on our behalf or donate your labor to us, nor allow us to determine the manner or result of your activities or accomplishments, nor shall there be any economic exchange thereby.\r\n\r\nTime is of the essence hereof. Non-enforcement of any provision herein does not constitute consent or waiver, and we reserve the right to enforce such provision at our sole discretion and at any time, without limitation, and regardless of any delay after we learn of any violation of the terms and conditions hereof and whether such delay be reasonable or unreasonable, and the waiver of any breach of any provision of this User Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. If any portion of this agreement shall be held unenforceable, invalid or inoperative, then, (a) the remainder of this agreement shall be considered valid and operative, and the remaining provisions shall be nevertheless carried into effect, and (b) insofar as it is reasonable and possible, effect shall be given to the intent manifested by the portion held unenforceable, invalid or inoperative, and such portion shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. The language of this User Agreement shall be construed as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party. WE WANT TO FULLFILL ANY OBLIGATIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE AND CONSEQUENTLY REQUIRE THAT YOU TELL US PROMPTLY IF THERE IS A PROBLEM AND GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE REMEDIAL ACTION. IF YOU SHOULD CONCLUDE OR DISCOVER FACTS WHICH REASONABLY INDICATE THAT WE HAVE VIOLATED THIS USER AGREEMENT, OR FAILED TO PERFORM ANY OBLIGATIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE, OR HAVE BREACHED A LEGAL DUTY, OR THAT WE HAVE BEEN NEGLIGENT, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY torrents.empornium.me BY E-MAIL AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY BUT WITHIN 12 HOURS, AND TO FOLLOW-UP BY PROVIDING ALL KNOWN SPECIFICS AND DETAILS BY E-MAIL NOTIFICATION TO webmaster@torrents.empornium.me WITHIN TEN DAYS. IF YOU FAIL TO GIVE THE FOREGOING TIMELY NOTICES TO US, YOU SHALL THEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the torrents.empornium.me site or this User Agreement must be filed by you within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action first arose, and regardless of when discovered, or be forever barred. The parties hereto stipulate and agree that (1) as the physical premises of the torrents.empornium.me site consist of the site\'s Internet webserver(s) and storage components thereof, these shall be construed as the site\'s real property, and (2) that the electronic signals created when the website or content thereof is used constitute the torrents.empornium.me site\'s physical personal property; neither of which shall be trespassed or converted by unauthorized entry, access, transfer, or use and our right to exclude others from trespassing and/or converting such property or from our virtual network premises is not equivalent to any rights protected by copyright. The parties hereto further stipulate and agree that use of this website or the content thereof in violation of this User Agreement causes actual and irreparable harm inflicted by such conduct, constitutes a substantial interference with possession or the right thereto, and shall give rise to causes of action for trespass, conversion, or the like, false advertising, federal and state trademark dilution, computer fraud and abuse, unfair competition, misappropriation, interference with prospective economic advantage, unjust enrichment, copyright infringement, and other causes of action as applicable, and that no remedy or election we choose shall be deemed exclusive but shall, wherever possible, be cumulative with all other remedies at law or in equity, and that each torrent or graphic shall constitute a separate copyrighted work. We reserve the right in our sole and unfettered discretion to deny you access to this website at any time for any reason or for no reason.\r\n\r\nPERMISSIONS - CONTENT LICENSING Additional Terms and Conditions for License to Reproduce Still Images or other website content: torrents.empornium.me strongly encourages permitted scholarly, educational, artistic, cultural, scientific, or commercial use that brings these torrents or other content to a wider audience. If you want permission, we sincerely hope that you don\'t get scared off by all this legalese and give up! We can only be friendly and helpful if we hear from you, and you tell us exactly what you need. Once you are certain of your needs, please write to torrents.empornium.me (or other owner or rights holder, as applicable) [\"Licensor\"] to apply to obtain access and use or reuse permission to reproduce torrent(s) or other content(s), in print, broadcast, video, film, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, Internet or any other electronic medium. Include in the application and statement of intent to license and use one or more torrents (your \"Request for License to Reproduce Still Images\") which constitutes your irrevocable order for a use license: the item requested; purpose, duration, and intended use of the requested item including the title or description, author or product, publisher or producer, publication or release date, placement location (at the interior, jacket, cover, or other location; or the URL if for Web use), size of the print run, territory (whether North America or worldwide), and whether in one language or all languages; the name or title, organization, street address, telephone, fax, and e-mail address of the proposed \"Licensee\"; and any special preferences (if any) regarding torrent resolution or format. Permission may be granted or withheld on a case by case basis at the sole discretion of Licensor. The fee for a license for reproduction of each of torrents.empornium.me\'s still torrents will be the same as set forth in the Use Fee Schedule (Still Images) and which schedule is incorporated herein by reference, for the one-time, one-use, non-exclusive, color publication use of each single torrent or other content for the purpose specified, and is never for an unlimited term, nor in perpetuity. The use fee for a license for reproduction of text is one thousandth of a U.S. dollar per word times the number of words times the number of copies, except in the case of Internet use where we generally follow the New York Times use fee schedule of one hundred dollars per article per 30 days or fraction thereof. The amount of the use fee may be adjusted by several cents in order to facilitate electronic tracking and verification of payments. Permitted use shall not exceed the use set forth in the application and statement of intent which shall be accurate. By submitting your request for permission or permissions inquiry, you are obligating yourself and your organization(s), if any, to license, immediately pay for, and to actually make use of the torrent(s) or other content requested in the manner as set forth in your application, should permission be granted. If you don\'t want to buy a license, don\'t e-mail us about permissions - it\'s that simple! You may not e-mail us regarding permissions if you lack decision authority. Your commitment to actually use the requested material is required because your request may set in motion a series of events whereby we expend considerable normally unreimbursed resources to comply with your request, which we do gladly and which we subsidize, but only in order to see these treasured torrents actually included with the best quality obtainable in publications, educational projects, or other approved endeavors. torrents.empornium.me makes no additional charge for duplication of torrents or other content when obtained in digital format by Licensee via the Internet under this agreement and actually used as specified in the application, but to avoid non-productive use of our extremely limited resources, please carefully decide which torrents you actually want and be certain that you have an adequate budget to be able to afford the torrents you request prior to submitting your application, as you are obligating yourself and the use fees will apply in full to each licensed torrent, even if you later change your mind or decide not to reproduce a licensed torrent(s).\r\n\r\nORDERS ONLY! - Use the above link to \"e-mail for permission\" only after you have decided that you definitely will use the torrent(s) should your application be approved and you are certain that you wish to commit yourself by placing a firm order for a \"License to Reproduce Still Images.\" [If you are being paid to work on a project, please understand that we won\'t do for free what you are being paid to do!] Please don\'t burden our very limited resources with unproductive, speculative, tentative, or incomplete requests that fail to completely specify your exact requirements or which reflect your failure to decide in advance whether you actually wish to license the requested torrent(s), or to examine the Use Fee Schedule. Abandoned application fee: There is no application fee, but you will be charged a one hundred U.S. dollar non-refundable abandoned application fee per e-mail for EACH AND EVERY E-MAILed \"Request for License to Reproduce Still Images,\" permissions inquiry, follow-up, or other permissions related e-mail that we receive from you that fails to ultimately result in your licensing at least one torrent or other requested content, including but not limited to e-mails related to torrent selection, questions, billing, and collection of fees, except that no abandoned application fee will apply if you submit a complete application in your first e-mail but none of the torrents that you request are available for licensing. Also, we may, at our sole discretion, deem your application to have been abandoned and charge the abandoned application fee if you fail to respond to each of our e-mails within 72 hours, if you reject a license which we approve in response to your request, fail to make timely payment as required herein, or tell us that you do not want a license. Customized torrent non-use penalty: Additionally, in the event that we rescan and/or reprocess a requested torrent(s) in response to your request for a high resolution version, a different size or format, or other variation from the online torrent file displayed on this website (\"customized torrent\"), and/or in an attempt to supply you in our sole discretion with the best possible torrent quality and you then fail to live up to your obligation to use the requested torrent, thereby wasting our resources, you agree to pay liquidated damages of three hundred U.S. dollars per torrent for non-use of each such customized torrent which you fail to use, not subject to fee waiver, in addition to the use fee and any other applicable charges. All fees listed are subject to change, are non-refundable, are subject to a fifty U.S. dollar per torrent minimum fee (one hundred dollar per torrent minimum fee for customized torrents), and may be reduced or waived in special circumstances, when requested in advance at the time of application, at the sole discretion of torrents.empornium.me and Licensor, and contingent on compliance with all terms of this User Agreement, but shall not be waived if use is without permission. The use fee for research access to the torrents.empornium.me website for a commercial project is $1,000/month with a six month minimum which amount may be applied to the cost of any torrents licensed hereunder for publication use for the project. If you find that none of the categories in the Use Fee Schedule apply to your intended use, you do not understand the use fee schedule, you are uncertain as to the applicable fee, or you wish us to consider your request for a use fee which differs from the fee schedule, you MUST specify in your application a specific proposed use fee dollar amount that you are offering. If the requested information needed to determine which of several possibly applicable levels of fees should apply is not provided in the application, the higher fee shall apply. If the use fee is unspecified herein or in the fee schedule and not agreed in advance, it shall be one hundred dollars per torrent per month. Rush: Add fifty percent to the stated fees for rush requests. E-mails flagged for special treatment with high priority/importance headers or the like or requests that torrents be made available for use in seven days or less from the date of the request also constitute rush requests. Our acceptance of any request, inquiry, or order placed by you is expressly made conditional on your assent to the terms set forth in this User Agreement, and not those in your request, inquiry, order, or e-mail. Buyer beware: You authorize us to act upon any e-mail you send to us requesting permission or permissions or making inquiry as constituting an order, whether the e-mail is formal or informal, complete or incomplete, including requests posed as questions, inquiries, or sent using e-mail links on other pages of our website which provide sufficient information to allow us to process the request (and to choose an torrent fulfilling the request in the event that a specific torrent is not requested) which shall constitute a binding order requesting a license to reproduce still torrents. [We know this may seem strange to you, but our policy really is necessary because due to factual, legal and/or technical issues we often have to research requests, search for torrents, and/or rescan and/or reprocess torrents in order for us to respond to your e-mail and/or determine if we will be able to successfully fulfill your licensing request, and as a result we may be almost done with your order before we can answer your e-mail.] For example, if you write informally to ask us about using one or more torrents that you saw on the torrents.empornium.me website and ask what the request will cost, while not specifying a price limit, you are thereby requesting and authorizing us to fill your order at a price consistent with the Use Fee Schedule and the terms and conditions of this User Agreement, and to let you know the total amount due for the license by sending you an electronic invoice which you are obligated to pay. Please pay close attention to what is written on this page: We want to avoid nasty surprises and disputes, so we are giving you fair warning that this is an e-commerce website with possibly unfamiliar policies and procedures and that clicking on the \"e-mail torrents.empornium.me for permission\" link above means \"buy a license now.\" Use fee(s) are non-refundable and shall be fully and promptly paid at the earlier of the times of your receipt of (1) the licensed content; (2) a grant of permission of access thereto for the purpose requested; or, (3) our invoice requesting payment in response to your request, and shall be immediately due and payable in advance of publication or other licensed use, shall be by check signed by the Licensee, in U.S. dollars, drawn on a United States bank, or sent by electronic funds transfer for the benefit of the Licensee, and payment shall be delivered to us or the Licensor\'s financial institution within ten days, according to the instructions you will receive.

IRC for Dummies','Basic guide for our IRC Channels','The easiest and fastest way to join the fun or get help on IRC is to use the IRC link at the top of your screen:\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-6373_5024677D.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[b][color=#FF0000]You do not have to worry about anonymity. Your IP is only visible to you and the top admins and is not logged.\r\n[/color][/b]\r\njust follow the indication and you will be teleported automajically in our chat channel and you can talk to other users and the site admins and also get help with your problems. Notice the two options. One channel is for general chit-chat the other is for getting help.\r\n\r\n[b]Pay attention to the topic as it gives important information:[/b]\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-C026_5024677D.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Few simple things you need to know.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]1. Joining a channel[/b] \r\nWhen using the webchat (that is what we call it) to access the IRC, you can access other channels in addition as well. Say you joined the regular channel but also want to access the help one? Simply use the [b]/join[/b] command like below:\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-9F82_5024677D.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nand notice the new channel appearing in a new tab on top.\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-AE4B_5024677D.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n[b]2. The Status Window[/b]\r\nWhen you get in things may happen a bit fast for you to see or notice but there is a status window you can also access for useful information. Check it out by clicking the tab. \r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-348B_5022C067.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nWhen you click the tab you will see it:\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-1B32_5022C139.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nOther than having a number of useful information, [color=#FF0000][b]and now [you] pay attention![/b][/color]\r\n\r\nIt is best to input commands in this window especially the ones involving your password. So if you mess up with a typo you can avoid that the whole channel sees your password.\r\n\r\nAlso some commands given in the channel show their result in the status window. So when you go WTF how come I do not see the result of my command, check the status window.\r\n\r\n[b]3. Private Chats[/b]\r\nYou can have private conversations with other users where only you two will see what is being said. But the etiquette requires you to ask first in the open channel if you do not know the user. You can do so by clicking on the user nick and selecting query.\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-9942_502469C1.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\neach private conversation will be put in a separate tab. You can have many at the same time. And switch among them. If you receive a message while you are in another window, you will hear a sound and the tab will turn red to indicate activity.\r\n\r\n[b]4. Slap[/b]\r\nDo not be tempted by the slap command is not polite....  :laugh: \r\n\r\n[b]5. User categories[/b]\r\nIn the channels there are several user categories. \r\n\r\nFirst are the [b]IRC Staff[/b]. There is a hierarchy in our type of channel. ÃœberGods (~), Gods (&), Godlets (@) and Godlins(%). You do not have to worry about it. Just respect them and obey them. They are benevolent but do not attract their wrath with bad behavior. Play nice and they will be more than happy to help you if you need. In some channels they are arrogant assholes not in ours. Quite the contrary. \r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-2183_502545A9.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThen there are [b]bots[/b]. These are not humans but programs that do useful things in the channel again no need to bother about them. Just know not to talk to them. Usually but not always they are indicated like [b]^botname^[/b]\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-878E_502546CD.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nThen the [b]voiced users[/b]. Voice is both functional and honorific. Function is to allow them to talk when the channel is put in moderated mode (rare for example in case of flame wars etc...). Honorific as it usually designate the regular contributing users. If you just idle you probably will not get voice. If you participate you will quickly get it. But you have to be registered. More on this later.\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-3392_502548AF.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nAnd finally the other users. Maybe be new ones or just idlers.\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-4200_50254CDE.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nHere is a more in depth explanation of the different user categories. According to the client used you may see them differently. From most to least powerful are:\r\n\r\n[img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-founder-symbol.png[/img][size=1]/[/size][img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-founder-graphic.png[/img] - Founder - ultimate power. Can do anything to the channel and those within it. Usually represents the user who registered the channel. Only certain networks support founders.\r\n[img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-admin-symbol.png[/img][size=1]/[/size][img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-admin-graphic.png[/img] - Admin - a normal operator, but protected from being kicked by anyone except the founder. Only certain networks support admins.\r\n[img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-op-symbol.png[/img][size=1]/[/size][img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-op-graphic.png[/img] - Operator (op) - the user can grant and revoke operator, half-operator and voice status, change the topic, kick other users and generally control the channel.\r\n[img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-halfop-symbol.png[/img][size=1]/[/size][img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-halfop-graphic.png[/img] - Half-operator (half-op) - the user has the power to moderate the channel, change the topic and kick people, but cannot kick other half-operators nor higher-ranking users, nor can he/she create new operators/half-operators. Only certain networks support half-operators.\r\n[img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-voice-symbol.png[/img][size=1]/[/size][img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-voice-graphic.png[/img] - Voice - the user can talk in the channel when it is moderated. Often used to mark people as trusted or helpful without giving them any real power.\r\n[size=1]/[/size][img]http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/common/image/userlist-no-graphic.png[/img] - Normal - the user has no special status.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]6. The /me command[/b]\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image-9D3E_50253E4D.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nHow does he do it? Is a FAQ. Simply use the [b]/me[/b] command like [b]/me yawns[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]7. Register and Identify[/b]\r\n\r\nNow that you familiarized yourself with IRC and our channels you may want to register your nickname. \r\nYou may register your full site nickname up to 31 characters. Some other IRCs have shorter lengths we do not. We do require that you use the same one you use on the site.\r\n\r\nRegistering your nickname has several advantages like for example nobody other than you can use it so nobody can steal your identity. Because once you register your nickname, one will need a password to use it.\r\n\r\nYou will also be added to the auto-voice list so you get voiced automatically every time you enter.\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000]Now [b]very important[/b] type these commands in the status window as well as all involving your password. So if you mess up you do not show your password in the channel for all to see!![/color]\r\n\r\nSo first make sure you are using the nickname you want. if not you can change it with:\r\n\r\n[b]/nick <nickname>[/b]\r\n\r\nexample : /nick barumba_is_the_man\r\n\r\nThen register your nickname:\r\n\r\n[b]/ns register <password> <email>[/b]\r\n\r\nexample: /ns register empircisfun barumba@gmail.com\r\n\r\nmake sure you use a password you remember!\r\nyou will not get an email notifications. This will only be used to recover your password. \r\nOnce given that command you are done. And you need to do it only once.\r\nIf you mess up contact the staff and they can help you fix it.\r\n\r\nOnce registered you need to announce yourself each time you enter [b]in the status window[/b] using:\r\n\r\n[b]/ns identify <password>[/b]\r\n\r\nexample: /ns identify empircisfun\r\n\r\nYou you can do it manually but with the new webchat interface you can have it done for you.\r\n\r\nFirst you select the channel(s) you want to join:\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=3D8D_504BE626[/img]\r\n\r\nThen you select the Auth pull-down menu and input your password:\r\n\r\n[img]http://xxx.freeimage.us/image.php?id=4293_504BE3AA[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you decide to use one of the many IRC clients you can automate this. You can refer to the IRC clients chapter if you decide to use one.\r\n\r\nThis concludes this guide.\r\n\r\nCreated by [url=http://empornium.mooo.com/user.php?id=70679]Barumba[/url].

XChat (thanks MrRandom for this)[/b][/#]\r\n\r\nHow to connect with xchat (this tutorial also works for clients based off of xchat such as HexChat)\r\n\r\nFirstly we need to get xchat installed. For linux users it should be in your repository e.g. ubuntu is \"sudo apt-get install xchat\". If you are on windows you can grab it from [url=http://www.silverex.org/download/]here[/url].\r\n\r\nWhen you first run xchat you will be presented with a server connect list.\r\n\r\n[img]http://xchat.org/docs/start/xchat-1-servlist.png[/img]\r\n\r\nChange your nickname and real name settings. Then click add to add a new IRC network and change the name to \"Empornium IRC\" and hit enter.\r\n\r\n[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3012235/static/xchat_server_edit.PNG[/img]\r\n\r\nClick edit double click on \"newserver/6667\" and change it to \"irc.digitalwizardry.org/6697\", [color=#FF0000]once edited click somewhere else or it will not be saved![/color] Click the check boxes on Use SSL and Accept invalid SSL Certificate, and if you registered your nickname enter the password you used.\r\n\r\n[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3012235/static/xchat_server_edit2.PNG[/img]\r\n\r\nClick the close button, then click connect and that\'s you you should be connected to Empornium IRC over secure SSL.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems feel free to drop by #empornium-help.\r\n\r\n[#=irssi][b]5. IRSSI[/b][/#]\r\n\r\nLinux and Mac only but there is a windows version in beta.\r\n\r\nGetting Connected\r\n\r\nThe first step is to start irssi. Run from your shell:\r\n\r\n[quote]irssi[/quote]\r\n\r\nYou should now see irssi in its default stateâ€“disconnected, with some blue bars at the top and bottom.\r\n\r\nIn irssi, there are three important connection-related commands: /server, /connect, and /disconnect. irssi can handle multiple IRC connections simultaneously, thus it is possible to be active in channels on different networks at the same time. The first command, /server, will connect to the specified server on the current network. On the other hand, /connect will open a new network connection and connect to the specified server on the new network.\r\n\r\nFor example, typing /connect irc.foo.com will open a new network connection and connect to irc.foo.com. If you then type /connect irc.bar.com, there will be two network connections open, one for irc.foo.com, one for irc.bar.com. Typing /server irc.baz.com while the network connection for irc.bar.com is active will disconnect the client from irc.bar.com and connect to irc.baz.com on that network connection. You can use ctrl-X to switch between network connections. You can see what the active network is by looking at the status bar, which looks something like this:\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3012235/static/irssi_connect.PNG[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n(05:23:10) (irssi-test[+Tiwxz]) (1:SilentZombies (change with ^X))\r\n\r\nAt this point you should have a just-opened instance of irssi, with no connections to any server. Connect to an IRC server by typing:\r\n\r\n[quote]/connect -ssl irc.digitalwizardry.org 6697[/quote]\r\n\r\nand change your nickname with:\r\n\r\n[quote]/nick [you][/quote]\r\n\r\nIf everything connected fine, join a channel by typing:\r\n\r\n[quote]/join #empornium[/quote]\r\n\r\n[align=center][img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3012235/static/irssi_channel_join.PNG[/img][/align]\r\n\r\n[b]Switching Windows[/b]\r\n\r\nYou should now notice that the â€œstatusâ€ window is now hidden, and youâ€™re looking at the channel you just joined. You should also notice that your status bar says â€œ2:#emporniumâ€. This means that the window for #empornium is assigned window number 2. The status window is by default window number 1. To switch between windows in Irssi, use Alt-#, where # is 0-9. Windows start at number 1, and Alt-0 goes to window number 10. You can use Alt-q through Alt-o for windows 11 to 19. It is possible to have more than 19 windows. Use Alt with the arrow keys to scroll through the windows.\r\n\r\nTip: If youâ€™re trying to get to end windows past 19, start at window 1, and then use Alt with the left arrow key.\r\n\r\nAdvanced note: use /help bind to learn about the /bind command. It can be used to assign keyboard shortcuts to windows past 19.\r\n\r\nTo get support for auto-identifying you to nickserv you will need to get an external plugin for irssi:[url=http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/nickserv.pl]http://scripts.irssi.org/scripts/nickserv.pl[/url]. Adding and managing plugins is beyond the scope of this tutorial but there are guides on how to do it on the IRSSI website.\r\n\r\n[#=limechat][b]6.

It is probably not perfect and can be improved upon but has worked for for quite some time. It is for version 3.1.2. To make this as easy as possible to follow below are screenshots of all settings panels. Above every screenshot is a small textual explanation.\r\n\r\nAt any time in uTorrent you can click the \"?\" in the blue circle up right for help on the panel options. If you see a reference to the \"I\" person that this would be one of our mods thanx to whom we have this overview.\r\n\r\n[b]General:[/b] Here is mostly up to you. Few things, I prefer it to start minimized.\r\nIMPORTANT : I found out that is a VERY good idea to check the the Pre-allocate option. This prevents the dreaded disk overload messages and loss of transfer speed as uTorrent keeps pre-allocating bits on the go.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii581/barumba1/Snap1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]UI Settings: [/b] Again mostly up to your taste. I prefer for added torrent not to start automatically. This is particularly handy for uploads as it gives the opportunity to set the file location and do the force check before starting.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii581/barumba1/Snap2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]Directories: [/b] This way things stay nice and organized.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii581/barumba1/Snap3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]Connection: [/b] This the port uTorrent uses and that needs to be openend in your router in its NAT table (both TCP and UDP) for this there is a post already that explains how you are connectable. You can also use the Setup Guide to test that this is true.\r\n[IMG]http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii581/barumba1/Snap4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]Bandwidth: [/b]This can be set running the wizard and tweaked later if you want to. You may want to limit rates if it is eating too much and you need to run other activities or if you have a crappy router that chokes after a while on fast connections. But best is to get a router that does not. Like a FritzBox. Zyxel are particularly bad in this respect.\r\n\r\nIf you are running under XP you may need to increase the connection numbers in the operating system. There are tools on line to do this.

You may need a different setting.\r\nOK I looked at this again recently and here are some of my findings. If you do not have fast transfer speeds you may leave the cache management to uTorrent. If you have high transfer speeds and/or see the disk overloaded warning then you may play with this value up and down until you have the minimum amount to avoid the disk overloaded warning. Actually I recently found out that having this value too high like in the picture may be not a good idea as it can cause uTorrent to gobble too much memory and end up freezing or crashing.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii581/barumba1/Snap17.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii581/barumba1/Snap18.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\n[b]Web UI & Run Program: [/b]I do not use them.

IRC User commands','Describes the command availabe to users','[align=center][b][size=2]IRC User commands[/size][/b][/align]\r\n\r\n[b]Basic IRC Commands in alphabetical order[/b]\r\n\r\n[color=#00CC00][v] : works on our IRC server[/color]\r\n[color=#FF0000][x] : does not work on our IRC server[/color]\r\n\r\nJust as you are able to surf the net with a few tricks to help make things easier, IRC is very similar. Below you will find some of the more common IRC commands that generally work on any IRC channel. Some of these commands may be available through your client user interface like with right click.\r\n\r\n[b]/chat[/b] [color=#FF0000][x][/color]\r\n    This opens up a DCC/CHAT window to another user. What\'s nice about these is that you can continue to chat even if you \r\n    get disconnected from your server. \r\n    Word of Caution: Do NOT accept dcc/chats nor dcc/gets from anyone that you don\'t know. \r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/chat nickname[/color]. \r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/chat CyberAvatar[/color] \r\n\r\n[b]/help[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    There\'s one more very helpful command, and probably the one you\'ll use a lot when first starting out. In fact, I still\r\n    use it quite a lot, and that\'s the built-in help menu of your IRC client. \r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/help[/color], you\'ll see the the options available specific to your IRC client.\r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/help[/color] \r\n\r\n[b]/ignore[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    Unfortunately, there will be times when you don\'t want to talk to someone, or else someone may be harassing you. \r\n    By typing [color=#FF0000]/ignore nickname[/color], you will not receive anymore messages from that person. \r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/ignore annoyinguser[/color] \r\n    To Unignore them, type [color=#FF0000]/unignore annoyinguser[/color] \r\n    \r\n[b]/join[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/join #channelname[/color] -- to join a channel of your choice \r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/join #empornium[/color]\r\n   \r\n[b]/me[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    The /me is an action message. \r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/me \'does anything\'[/color] \r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/me waves hello[/color] \r\n    \r\n[b]/msg[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/msg nickname (message)[/color] to start a private chat. \r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/msg MrRandom Hey there, how are you?[/color] \r\n    Warning: IRC etiquette requires you to know the person or to ask first in the open channel.\r\n\r\n[b]/nick[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    changes your nickname \r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/nick newnickname[/color]\r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/nick barumba[/color](limit 9 characters in some systems up to 31 in ours) \r\n        \r\n[b]/notice[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    A notice is used to send a short message to another person without opening up a private window. \r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/notice nickname (message)[/color] \r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/notice clownius Please change your nickname for this channel.[/color] \r\n    \r\n[b]/part[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/part[/color] -- to leave one channel \r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/partall[/color] -- to leave all the channels you are in\r\n\r\n[b]/ping[/b] [color=#FF0000][x][/color]\r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/ping nickname[/color]. What this command does is give you the ping time, or lag time, between you and the person you \r\n    pinged. Lag can be explained as the amount of time it takes for you to type your message and for others to read your\r\n    messages. Unfortunately, lag is always a part of IRC, although most times it\'s not a problem, just a nuisance. \r\n\r\n[b]/query[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    Similar to the /msg, except it forces a window to pop open and gives you a whois information.\r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/query nickname (message)[/color] \r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/query elkid Sooo....what\'s new?[/color] \r\n    Warning: same as /msg\r\n\r\n[b]/quit[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/quit [message][/color]to leave IRC altogether. This disconnects you from the server. Message is optional. I also clould close your client.\r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/quit Going out for dinner...nite all[/color] \r\n    \r\n[b]/whois[/b] [color=#00CC00][v][/color]\r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/whois nickname[/color] to see a bit more information about another user. You\'ll see what server another person is using, \r\n    or what their ISP is (on some systems, not ours the IP is masked for privacy purposes). Pretty helpful when you don\'t \r\n    recognize a nickname that wants to chat. You may recognize the IP, (Internet Protocol, again not shown in our system but\r\n    the owner and admins) and then feel more comfortable carrying on a conversation. You\'ll also be able to see what other \r\n    channels a person is in, which might be a good indicator if you really want to talk with them or not. \r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/whois mifune[/color]\r\n\r\n[color=#FF0000]*************** Below is work in progress, this warning will be removed once done ********[/color]    \r\n\r\n[b]Additional IRC Commands in alphabetical order[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]/admin[/b]\r\n    Provides Administrative information regarding the server.\r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/admin[/color] \r\n\r\n[b]/away[/b]\r\n    Sets your online status to \"Away\". \r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/away reason[/color]\r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/away lunchtime!\r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/away[/color] to cancel away status\r\n\r\n[b]/dccallow <<+|->nick<,<+|->nick, ...>> <list> <help>[/b]\r\n    DCC is the file exchange system in IRC. You may allow DCCs of files which are otherwise blocked by the IRC server\r\n    by specifying a DCC allow for the user you want to recieve files from.\r\n    For instance, to allow the user Crozz to send you file.exe\r\n    Type [color=#FF0000]/dccallow +Crozz[/color]\r\n    and Crozz will then be able to send you files. Crozz will have to resend the file\r\n    if the server gave him an error message before you added him to your allow list.\r\n    [color=#FF0000]/dccallow -Crozz[/color]\r\n    Will do the exact opposite, removing him from your dcc allow list.\r\n    [color=#FF0000]/dccallow list[/color]\r\n    Will list the users currently on your dcc allow list.\r\n    [color=#FF0000]/dccallow help[/color]\r\n    will get you help on this command.\r\n\r\n[b]/invite <<user> <channel>>[/b]\r\n    Sends a user an Invitation to join a particular channel.\r\n    If the channel is +i (invisible), you must be an Operator to use this command, otherwise any user may use the command.\r\n    Invite without parameters lists the channels you have been invited to.\r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/invite cocktail #empornium[/color]\r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/invite[/color]\r\n\r\n[b]/ison <user1> <user2> <user3> <user4>[/b]\r\n    Used to determine if certain user(s) are currently online based upon their nickname.\r\n    Example: [color=#FF0000]/ison MrRandom Barumba Clownius Yamchan[/color]\r\n    \r\n\r\n','2012-08-26 20:43:04'),(71,2,4,'irc_halfop',0,'IRC Half Operator Commands','Describes the command availabe to half operators','','2012-08-16 21:30:02'),(72,2,4,'irc_op',0,'IRC Operator commands','Describes the command availabe to operators','','2012-08-16 21:29:17'),(73,2,4,'irc_admin',0,'IRC Adminstrator commands','Describes the command availabe to administrators','','2012-08-16 21:28:58'),(74,2,4,'irc_founder',0,'IRC Founder commands','Describes the command availabe to fouders','','2012-08-16 21:29:42'),(75,2,4,'irc_dump',0,'Dump article for all IRC stuff (DO NOT DELETE)','Used for moving things from the forum into a central repo.','============= NickServ Commands =============\r\n\r\nNickServ Commands\r\n\r\nNickServ allows you to â€œregisterâ€ a nickname and prevent others from using it. The following commands allow for registration and maintenance of nicknames; to use them, type /msg NickServ command. For more information on a specific command, type /msg NickServ HELP command.\r\n \r\n[b]REGISTER[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ REGISTER password [email]\r\n \r\n Registers your nickname in the NickServ database.  Once\r\n your nick is registered, you can use the SET and ACCESS\r\n commands to configure your nick\'s settings as you like\r\n them.  Make sure you remember the password you use when\r\n registering - you\'ll need it to make changes to your nick\r\n later.  (Note that case matters!  ANOPE, Anope, and\r\n anope are all different passwords!)\r\n \r\n Guidelines on choosing passwords:\r\n \r\n Passwords should not be easily guessable.  For example,\r\n using your real name as a password is a bad idea.  Using\r\n your nickname as a password is a much worse idea ;) and,\r\n in fact, NickServ will not allow it.  Also, short\r\n passwords are vulnerable to trial-and-error searches, so\r\n you should choose a password at least 5 characters long.\r\n Finally, the space character cannot be used in passwords.\r\n \r\n The parameter email is optional and will set the email\r\n for your nick immediately. However, it may be required\r\n on certain networks.\r\n Your privacy is respected; this e-mail won\'t be given to\r\n any third-party person.\r\n \r\n This command also creates a new group for your nickname,\r\n that will allow you to register other nicks later sharing\r\n the same configuration, the same set of memos and the\r\n same channel privileges. For more information on this\r\n feature, type /msg NickServ HELP GROUP.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]GROUP[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  GROUP target password\r\n \r\n This command makes your nickname join the target nickname\'s\r\n group. password is the password of the target nickname.\r\n \r\n Joining a group will allow you to share your configuration,\r\n memos, and channel privileges with all the nicknames in the\r\n group, and much more!\r\n \r\n A group exists as long as it is useful. This means that even\r\n if a nick of the group is dropped, you won\'t lose the\r\n shared things described above, as long as there is at\r\n least one nick remaining in the group.\r\n \r\n You can use this command even if you have not registered\r\n your nick yet. If your nick is already registered, you\'ll\r\n need to identify yourself before using this command. Type\r\n /msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more information. This\r\n last may be not possible on your IRC network.\r\n \r\n It is recommended to use this command with a non-registered\r\n nick because it will be registered automatically when\r\n using this command. You may use it with a registered nick (to\r\n change your group) only if your network administrators allowed\r\n it.\r\n \r\n You can only be in one group at a time. Group merging is\r\n not possible.\r\n \r\n Note: all the nicknames of a group have the same password.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]IDENTIFY[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  IDENTIFY password\r\n \r\n Tells NickServ that you are really the owner of this\r\n nick.  Many commands require you to authenticate yourself\r\n with this command before you use them.  The password\r\n should be the same one you sent with the REGISTER\r\n command.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]LOGOUT[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  LOGOUT\r\n \r\n This reverses the effect of the IDENTIFY command, i.e.\r\n make you not recognized as the real owner of the nick\r\n anymore. Note, however, that you won\'t be asked to reidentify\r\n yourself.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]DROP[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  DROP [nickname]\r\n \r\n Drops your nickname from the NickServ database.  A nick\r\n that has been dropped is free for anyone to re-register.\r\n \r\n You may drop a nick within your group by passing it\r\n as the nick parameter.\r\n \r\n In order to use this command, you must first identify\r\n with your password (/msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more\r\n information).[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]ACCESS[b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  ACCESS ADD mask\r\n         ACCESS DEL mask\r\n         ACCESS LIST\r\n \r\n Modifies or displays the access list for your nick.  This\r\n is the list of addresses which will be automatically\r\n recognized by NickServ as allowed to use the nick.  If\r\n you want to use the nick from a different address, you\r\n need to send an IDENTIFY command to make NickServ\r\n recognize you.\r\n \r\n Examples:\r\n \r\n     ACCESS ADD anyone@*.bepeg.com\r\n         Allows access to user anyone from any machine in\r\n         the bepeg.com domain.\r\n \r\n     ACCESS DEL anyone@*.bepeg.com\r\n         Reverses the previous command.\r\n \r\n     ACCESS LIST\r\n         Displays the current access list.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET option parameters\r\n \r\n Sets various nickname options.  option can be one of:\r\n \r\n     DISPLAY    Set the display of your group in Services\r\n     PASSWORD   Set your nickname password\r\n     LANGUAGE   Set the language Services will use when\r\n                    sending messages to you\r\n     URL        Associate a URL with your nickname\r\n     EMAIL      Associate an E-mail address with your nickname\r\n     ICQ        Associate an ICQ number with your nickname\r\n     GREET      Associate a greet message with your nickname\r\n     KILL       Turn protection on or off\r\n     SECURE     Turn nickname security on or off\r\n     PRIVATE    Prevent your nickname from appearing in a\r\n                    /msg NickServ LIST\r\n     HIDE       Hide certain pieces of nickname information\r\n     MSG        Change the communication method of Services\r\n     AUTOOP     Should services op you automatically.\r\n \r\n In order to use this command, you must first identify\r\n with your password (/msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more\r\n information).\r\n \r\n Type /msg NickServ HELP SET option for more information\r\n on a specific option.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]SET DISPLAY[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET DISPLAY new-display\r\n \r\n Changes the display used to refer to your nickname group in\r\n Services. The new display MUST be a nick of your group.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET PASSWORD[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET PASSWORD new-password\r\n \r\n Changes the password used to identify you as the nick\'s\r\n owner.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET URL[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET URL url\r\n \r\n Associates the given URL with your nickname.  This URL\r\n will be displayed whenever someone requests information\r\n on your nick with the INFO command.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]SET EMAIL[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET EMAIL address\r\n \r\n Associates the given E-mail address with your nickname.\r\n This address will be displayed whenever someone requests\r\n information on the nickname with the INFO command.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]SET HIDE[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET HIDE {EMAIL | STATUS | USERMASK | QUIT} {ON | OFF}\r\n \r\n Allows you to prevent certain pieces of information from\r\n being displayed when someone does a NickServ INFO on your\r\n nick.  You can hide your E-mail address (EMAIL), last seen\r\n user@host mask (USERMASK), your services access status\r\n (STATUS) and  last quit message (QUIT).\r\n The second parameter specifies whether the information should\r\n be displayed (OFF) or hidden (ON).[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]SET ICQ[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET ICQ number\r\n \r\n Associates the given ICQ number with your nickname.  This\r\n number will be displayed whenever someone requests\r\n information on your nick with the INFO command.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]SET GREET[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET GREET message\r\n \r\n Makes the given message the greet of your nickname, that\r\n will be displayed when joining a channel that has GREET\r\n option enabled, provided that you have the necessary\r\n access on it.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET KILL[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET KILL {ON | QUICK | IMMED | OFF}\r\n \r\n Turns the automatic protection option for your nick\r\n on or off.  With protection on, if another user\r\n tries to take your nick, they will be given one minute to\r\n change to another nick, after which NickServ will forcibly change\r\n their nick.\r\n \r\n If you select QUICK, the user will be given only 20 seconds\r\n to change nicks instead of the usual 60.  If you select\r\n IMMED, user\'s nick will be changed immediately without being\r\n warned first or given a chance to change their nick; please\r\n do not use this option unless necessary.  Also, your\r\n network\'s administrators may have disabled this option.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET SECURE[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET SECURE {ON | OFF}\r\n \r\n Turns NickServ\'s security features on or off for your\r\n nick.  With SECURE set, you must enter your password\r\n before you will be recognized as the owner of the nick,\r\n regardless of whether your address is on the access\r\n list.  However, if you are on the access list, NickServ\r\n will not auto-kill you regardless of the setting of the\r\n KILL option.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET PRIVATE[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET PRIVATE {ON | OFF}\r\n \r\n Turns NickServ\'s privacy option on or off for your nick.\r\n With PRIVATE set, your nickname will not appear in\r\n nickname lists generated with NickServ\'s LIST command.\r\n (However, anyone who knows your nickname can still get\r\n information on it using the INFO command.)[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET MSG[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET MSG {ON | OFF}\r\n \r\n Allows you to choose the way Services are communicating with\r\n you. With MSG set, Services will use messages, else they\'ll\r\n use notices.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]UPDATE[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  UPDATE\r\n Updates your current status, i.e. it checks for new memos,\r\n sets needed chanmodes (ModeonID) and updates your vhost and\r\n your userflags (lastseentime, etc).[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]RECOVER[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  RECOVER nickname [password]\r\n \r\n Allows you to recover your nickname if someone else has\r\n taken it; this does the same thing that NickServ does\r\n automatically if someone tries to use a kill-protected\r\n nick.\r\n \r\n When you give this command, NickServ will bring a fake\r\n user online with the same nickname as the user you\'re\r\n trying to recover your nick from.  This causes the IRC\r\n servers to disconnect the other user.  This fake user will\r\n remain online for NickServ to ensure that the other\r\n user does not immediately reconnect; after that time, you\r\n can reclaim your nick.  Alternatively, use the RELEASE\r\n command (/msg NickServ HELP RELEASE) to get the nick\r\n back sooner.\r\n \r\n In order to use the RECOVER command for a nick, your\r\n current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick\'s\r\n access list, you must be identified and in the group of\r\n that nick, or you must supply the correct password for\r\n the nickname.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]RELEASE[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  RELEASE nickname [password]\r\n \r\n Instructs NickServ to remove any hold on your nickname\r\n caused by automatic kill protection or use of the RECOVER\r\n command.  This holds lasts for NickServ;\r\n this command gets rid of them sooner.\r\n \r\n In order to use the RELEASE command for a nick, your\r\n current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick\'s\r\n access list, you must be identified and in the group of\r\n that nick, or you must supply the correct password for\r\n the nickname.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]GHOST[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  GHOST nickname [password]\r\n \r\n Terminates a \"ghost\" IRC session using your nick.  A\r\n \"ghost\" session is one which is not actually connected,\r\n but which the IRC server believes is still online for one\r\n reason or another.  Typically, this happens if your\r\n computer crashes or your Internet or modem connection\r\n goes down while you\'re on IRC.\r\n \r\n In order to use the GHOST command for a nick, your\r\n current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick\'s\r\n access list, you must be identified and in the group of\r\n that nick, or you must supply the correct password for\r\n the nickname.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]INFO[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  INFO nickname [ALL]\r\n \r\n Displays information about the given nickname, such as\r\n the nick\'s owner, last seen address and time, and nick\r\n options. If you are identified for the nick you\'re\r\n getting information for and ALL is specified, you will\r\n be shown all the information; regardless of whether\r\n it\'s hidden or not.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]LIST[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  LIST pattern\r\n \r\n Lists all registered nicknames which match the given\r\n pattern, in nick!user@host format.  Nicks with the\r\n PRIVATE option set will not be displayed.\r\n \r\n Examples:\r\n \r\n     LIST *!joeuser@foo.com\r\n         Lists all nicks owned by joeuser@foo.com.\r\n \r\n     LIST *Bot*!*@*\r\n         Lists all registered nicks with Bot in their\r\n         names (case insensitive).\r\n \r\n     LIST *!*@*.bar.org\r\n         Lists all nicks owned by users in the bar.org\r\n         domain.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]ALIST[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  ALIST [level]\r\n \r\n Lists all channels you have access on. Optionally, you can specify\r\n a level in XOP or ACCESS format. The resulting list will only\r\n include channels where you have the given level of access.\r\n\r\n Examples:\r\n     ALIST Founder\r\n         Lists all channels where you have Founder\r\n         access.\r\n\r\n     ALIST AOP\r\n         Lists all channels where you have AOP\r\n         access or greater.\r\n\r\n     ALIST 10\r\n         Lists all channels where you have level 10\r\n         access or greater.\r\n\r\n Channels that have the NOEXPIRE option set will be\r\n prefixed by an exclamation mark.[/quote]\r\n[b]GLIST[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  GLIST\r\n \r\n Lists all nicks in your group.[/quote]\r\n[b]STATUS[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  STATUS nickname...\r\n \r\n Returns whether the user using the given nickname is\r\n recognized as the owner of the nickname.  The response has\r\n this format:\r\n \r\n     nickname status-code\r\n \r\n where nickname is the nickname sent with the command, and\r\n status-code is one of the following:\r\n \r\n     0 - no such user online or nickname not registered\r\n     1 - user not recognized as nickname\'s owner\r\n     2 - user recognized as owner via access list only\r\n     3 - user recognized as owner via password identification\r\n \r\n Up to sixteen nicknames may be sent with each command; the\r\n rest will be ignored. If no nickname is given, your status\r\n will be returned.[/quote]\r\n \r\n ============= Registration Nickname =============\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistering your nickname on Empornium IRC provides a number of benefits. The most notable of these is that registering your nickname prevents other people from using it. Once a user starts using the nickname, they will be asked to â€˜identifyâ€™ to it with a password. If they fail to do so, their nickname will be changed. This helps to stop people posing as you.\r\n\r\nOnce you register your nickname, you can be added to the auto voice and op lists in other peopleâ€™s channels. This enables you to be a permanent staff member in channels. You are also entitled to a vhost once you have been registered.\r\n\r\nRegistration provides you with many benefits and is completely free.\r\n\r\nTo register your nickname on Empornium IRC, you must first be using it. If you are not currently using it, change to it with the command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/nick <nickname>[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[quote]/nick CrazyUser[/quote]\r\n\r\nOnce you are using the nickname, you may register it in one of two ways. In any client, use the following command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns register <password> <e-mail>[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns register supersecretpassword crazyuser@hotmail.com[/quote]\r\n\r\nFollowing this, you will be sent an e-mail giving you the details required to finish off the registration. Follow the instructions in the e-mail.\r\n\r\nEach time you connect and start using the registered, you will be told that â€œThis nick is owned by someone elseâ€. You must â€˜identifyâ€™ to it using the following command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns identify <password>[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns identify supersecretpassword[/quote]\r\n\r\nIf you use mIRC, you can load the following script into the Remotes section of your script editor (press alt+R to access this) to identify you automatically. Just replace â€˜YOURPASSWORDHEREâ€™ with your actual password:\r\n\r\non 1:NOTICE:*This nickname is registered and protected*:?: {\r\n   if ($nick == NickServ) {\r\n      ns identify YOURPASSWORDHERE\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\non 1:NOTICE:*This nick is owned by someone else*:?: {\r\n   if ($nick == NickServ) {\r\n      ns identify YOURPASSWORDHERE\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\nIf you require help, come and see us in [url=http://torrents.empornium.me/irc.php]#empornium-help on irc.emprn.tk[/url]. Users who have registered with NickServ will automatically get voiced in the channel when they join.\r\n\r\n============= Registration Channel =============\r\n\r\nRegistering your channel on Empornium IRC gives you many advantages, and is completely free. These include:\r\n\r\nIncreased control over your channel\r\nAbility to add people to the auto op list\r\nAbility to add auto kicks\r\nAbility to use a services bot to auto moderate your channel\r\nAnd many many moreâ€¦\r\nTo register your channel, you must first register your nickname. To do this, when you are using the nickname that you wish to register, type the following command into your IRC client:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns register password e-mail[/quote]\r\n\r\nYou must replace password and e-mail with a real password and e-mail address, respectively. An example of the use of this command is:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns register supersecretpassword fred@hotmail.com[/quote]\r\n\r\nIt is important that you use your real e-mail address as this will be used in future if you ever forget your password. We will not send any unsolicited e-mail to this address.\r\n\r\nOnce you have registered your nickname, you can register your channel. All channels names begin with the # symbol, for example #help, #chris and #247fixes. Once you have picked a channel name, you can join it using the command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/join #channel[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[quote]/join #chat[/quote]\r\n\r\nOnce you have joined the channel, if it is not already registered, you should see your name in the nickname list with the @ symbol next to it. This means you are an operator in the channel. You may now register it with the following command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/cs register #channel password description[/quote]\r\n\r\nYou must replace #channel, password and description with the channel name, the channel password and a description of the channel. An example of the use of this command is:\r\n\r\n[quote]/cs register #chat verysecretpassword Freds chat channel[/quote]\r\n\r\nOnce you have done that, you should see your name in the nick list prefixed with the ~ symbol. This means you are the owner of the channel.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems registering your channel, come and talk to us in #help on irc.emprn.tk\r\n\r\n============= Extended Bans =============\r\n\r\n[b]Silencing Users with Extended Bans[/b]\r\nYou can use extended bans to set up an alternative kind of ban that will give you more options, like silencing users.\r\n\r\nWhen you silence a user, you allow the person to stay in the channel, but block the personâ€™s ability to participate in the discussion or change nicks. Itâ€™s an online equivalent of a short timeout, where the person has to sit quietly for several minutes before rejoining discussion.\r\n\r\nTo silence a user manually, youâ€™d type:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +bb ~q:nick!ident@user.host ~n:nick!ident@user.host[/quote]\r\nThat command sets two bans, which is why the host information is listed twice. The first one (~q:nick!ident@user.host) prevents the user from participating in the discussion (unless the user is +v or higher). The ~q stands for quiet. The second one (~n: nick!ident user.host) prevents the user from changing nicks. The ~n stands for nick.\r\n\r\nIn #YourChannel, bans are normally set by the userâ€™s host, so an example ban would look like this:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +bb ~n:*!*@protectedhost-1234578.hsd1.va.comcast.net ~q:*!*@protectedhost-1234578.hsd1.va.comcast.net[/quote]\r\nThat example bans anyone (with any nick or ident) with the hostmask protectedhost-12345678.hsd1.va.comcast.net.\r\n\r\n \r\n[b]Removing a Silence Extended Ban[/b]\r\nIf you silence a user manually, you have to remove the ban manually as well. Since you set the ban with +b, you will remove it by using the same command, but with -b. So to remove the ban, you would type:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel -bb ~q:nick!ident@user.host ~n:nick!ident@user.host[/quote]\r\nEverything is the same. Youâ€™re just removing the ban. Hereâ€™s the way to remove the example ban from above:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel -bb ~n:*!*@protectedhost-1234578.hsd1.va.comcast.net ~q:*!*@protectedhost-1234578.hsd1.va.comcast.net[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]Setting a Channel Extended Ban[/b]\r\nThere are two other kinds of extended bans:\r\n\r\n~c sets an extended ban based on a channel users are in\r\n~r sets an extended ban based on a userâ€™s real name\r\nYou are unlikely to need either of these bans, but for the sake of thoroughness here is how they work.\r\n\r\nTo set an extended channel ban, youâ€™d type:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +b ~c:#channel[/quote]\r\nThat ban would prevent anyone in #channel from joining #YourChannel.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s pretend thereâ€™s a channel called #YourChannelHaters. We might decide that we do not want anyone from #YourChannelHaters to join #YourChannel. We could use this extended ban to prevent them from joining #YourChannel:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +b ~c:#YourChannelHaters[/quote]\r\nYou remove this kind of ban by switching to -b, so I could remove the ban on folks from #YourChannelHaters like this:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel -b ~c:#YourChannelHaters[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]Setting a Real Name Extended Ban[/b]\r\nTo set an extended ban based on a userâ€™s real name, youâ€™d type:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +b ~r:*real_name*[/quote]\r\nThe * character works as a wildcard, just as it does in other bans. Use the underscore character ( _ ) to represent spaces in the userâ€™s real name. The underscore is also interpreted as an actual underscore character. In other words, the ban above would block someone using either â€œreal nameâ€ (with a space) or â€œreal_nameâ€ (with an underscore).\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s an example: \r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel +b ~r:*Jane_Doe*[/quote]\r\nThat ban would prevent anyone who was using the real name â€œJane Doeâ€ or â€œJane_Doeâ€ from joining #YourChannel. Because of the * wildcard, someone with a real name like â€œJane Doe rulesâ€ or â€œJane_Doe_rulesâ€ would also be banned.\r\n\r\nYou remove this kind of ban by switching to -b, so I could remove the ban on â€œJane Doe â€ like this:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #YourChannel -b ~r:*Jane_Doe*[/quote]\r\n\r\n============= Make A Channel Private =============\r\n\r\nAt least twice a month, someone will come into #help asking about private channels or how they can secure their channel to prevent anyone except those they want in it. Since there are probably those that would like to know, but donâ€™t ask, here is the quick and dirty guide to private/secret channels.\r\n\r\nEvery channel is able to be either private (+p), or secret (+s). The two modes are similar, but it is possible for people to find out about a channel that is marked private (+p). Therefore, if you want a channel nobody will be able to find out about unless theyâ€™re told, it is recommended that you mark it as secret, +s. Unless you are in the channel or an IRCop, the server will pretend that the channel doesnâ€™t exist.\r\n\r\nThere is also channel mode +i, which will let people in only when they have been invited. If the channel is registered with chanserv, those on the access list can /msg chanserv invite #channel, and chanserv (or the botserv bot, if the channel has one) will invite the person into the channel. Standing invites can also be set using channel mode +I, which takes a nick!ident@host mask as a parameter. If the person is not on the access list, and does not have +I set for themselves, they are able to â€œknockâ€ on the channel by doing /knock #channel optional_message.\r\n\r\nYou can also set a â€œkeyâ€ on the channel using channel mode +k, which takes the key to use as a parameter. If I wanted to set a key on my channel, I would do /mode #serenity +k Kaylee. In order to get in the channel, someone would need to specify the key when they try to join â€“ /join #serenity Kaylee. Alternatively, they can also be invited into the channel and will not need the key.\r\n\r\nIf the channel is registered, those modes can be mlockâ€™ed, so that they will be reapplied when the channel is recreated (i.e. is empty and someone joins). It is important to note that if the channel is empty, needing a key or an invite is not necessary to join the channel. That is where the next item comes into play.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to set a channel to have restricted access. When this option is set, only the people you add to the access list will be able to join. When someone that is not on the list attempts to join, they are kickbanned by chanserv (or the botserv bot, if you have added one) with the reason â€œYou are not permitted to be on this channelâ€.\r\n\r\nSince when you set your channel to restricted access you normally donâ€™t want people to know about it, it is recommended to also mlock it +s. To set both the restricted access and mlock, you need to enter the following two commands, replacing #channel with your actual channel:\r\n[quote]/msg chanserv set #channel mlock +s[/quote]\r\n[quote]/msg chanserv set #channel restricted on[/quote]\r\nNote: If you already have some modes set with mlock, you will need to respecify them when you add +s. So if you have +n (no external messages) set with mlock, you would need to do /msg chanserv set #channel mlock +sn.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions concerning setting your channel to restricted access, feel free to stop in #help and ask.\r\n\r\n============= Grouping Nicks =============\r\n\r\nSo youâ€™ve registered your nick, but have more than one computer/device that you join IRC from. You might be wondering â€œdo I need to register a new nick and have people add that nick to access lists as well? Certainly there must be an easier way.â€\r\n\r\nWell luckily for you, there is. You are able to group nicks together so that permissions and other data are shared among accounts. Some of the items that are shared include (but are not limited to): channel ownership, permission levels (owner, halfop, etc.) on channels, group info that was provided when you registered, password, and virtual host. Pretty much anything your single nick has associated with it will be associated with the group of nicks that you have registered.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s how to group a nick to one that you already have registered:\r\nSwitch to the nick that you want to group\r\nNOTE 1: Before you enter the next command, make sure that you are using the nick you want to add to your existing group. Do NOT be using your main nick. Example: if I wanted to group JayneCobb to my account, I would /nick JayneCobb.\r\nNOTE 2: If you use a registered nick when the next step if performed, it will first be dropped, then grouped to the main nick. Example: if I try to group JayneCobb (which is registered) to my main nick MalcolmReynolds, Services will first drop JayneCobb, then have it join the MalcolmReynolds group. By being dropped, any permissions JayneCobb had will be gone.\r\nEnter the following command in the server/status window: /msg nickserv group main_nick password, where main_nick is your primary nick, and password is the password belonging to the primary nick.\r\nExample: I want to group JayneCobb to my primary nick, MalcolmReynolds, and the password for it is S3reni+yV@ll3y (you do use something secure for your passwords, right?). I would type the following as JayneCobb: /msg nickserv group MalcolmReynolds S3reni+yV@ll3y\r\nLook for nickserv to either tell you that you have joined the group of your primay nick or give you an error message, such as â€œyou must wait at least 60 seconds before using the group command againâ€.\r\nAnd just to give you the commands again, they are, in order:\r\n[quote]/nick theNewNick[/quote]\r\n[quote]/msg nickserv group main_nick password[/quote]\r\n\r\nNow what if you want to delink a nick, i.e. remove it from the group, is there some way to do that? Yes there is, you just drop it by switching to the nick, and doing /msg nickserv drop. Doing that will make nickserv completely drop the nick â€“ it will no longer exist, have any permissions, etc.\r\n\r\nIs there someway to delink it without dropping, or without it losing the permissions and other information? Not currently, although I suppose it is possible that it could end up in a future version of anope, or someone could create a module that could drop a nick and register it using the credentials of the former group and preserving permissions, etc.\r\n\r\nShould you have any questions about grouping nicks, feel free to leave a comment here, or to join #help and ask in there.\r\n\r\n\r\n=========== Flood Protection ===========\r\n\r\nThe +f channel mode provides comprehensive flood protection for a channel. This mode allows you to prevent join, nick change, CTCP, text, and knock floods. The syntax for this modeâ€™s parameter is as follows:\r\n\r\n/mode #channel +f [{#}{,...}]:\r\n\r\nThe amount specifies the number of times the specified flood must occur before action is taken. Below are the available types:\r\n\r\nType	Name	Default Actions	Other Actions\r\nc	CTCP	+C (no channel CTCPs allowed)	m (only voiced users can speak), M (only registered users can speak)\r\nj	Join	+i (invite only)	R (only registered users can join)\r\nk	Knock	+K (no knocks allowed)	 \r\nm	Messages	+m (only voiced users can speak)	+M (only registered users can speak)\r\nn	Nickname Change	+N (no nickname changes allowed)	 \r\nt	Text	User is kicked from the channel	+b (user is banned from the channel)\r\nThe difference between type m and t is that m is tallied for the entire channel whereas t is tallied per user.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to specify an action for a mode, you may also specify a time (in minutes) after which the specific action will be reversed.\r\n\r\nAn example of the use of this command is:\r\n\r\n/mode #chills +f [2c#C5,6j#R3,3k#K10,15m#m5,5n#N3,5t#b60]:5\r\n\r\nThis meansâ€¦\r\n\r\nIf there are 2 channel CTCP messages (2c) in 5 seconds(:5) set mode +C for 5 mins (#C5)\r\nIf there are 6 joins (6j) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +R for 3 mins (#R3)\r\nIf there are 3 /KNOCK commands on the channel (3k) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +K for 10 mins (#K10)\r\nIf there are 15 messages in total from all users (15m) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +m for 5 mins (#m5)\r\nIf there are 5 nickname changes (n5) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +N for 3 mins (#N3)\r\nIf there are 5 messages from any single user (5t) in 5 seconds (:5) ban the user for 60 mins (#b60)\r\nIt has been observed lately that bot nets are joining channels and rapidly joining and parting. In order to prevent this, you can use channel mode j. This mode will allow only x joins to your channel in y seconds for each client. The recommended setting for this is 1 join in 1 second as this will entirely eradicate join/part flooding from botnets. An example of the use of this is:\r\n\r\n/mode #chills +j 1:1\r\n\r\nIf you need any help, come and see us in #help on irc.geekshed.net\r\n\r\n============= Fantasy/Bot Commands =============\r\n\r\nFantasy commands allows you to use simple shortcuts in place of many of the NickServ, ChanServ, and BotServ commands. \r\n\r\nThe available commands are listed below; to use them, just type the command indicated (for instance, For more information on a specific command, type !help command.) \r\n\r\nThe Fantasy commands are arranged in xxx areas:\r\nGeneral Commands â€“ General commands available. No special access required.\r\nAccess Control Commands â€“ Commands to manipulate channel access and levels list(s).\r\nChannel Settings Commands â€“ Commands to configure the channelsâ€™ settings and lists.\r\nChannel Action Commands â€“ Commands that will make services perform certain actions.\r\nChannel Modes Commands â€“ Commands that set certain channel modes.\r\n\r\nUsing Fantasy Commands\r\nTo use Fantasy commands, you first have to turn on the option, using this command:\r\n/msg botserv set #channel fantasy on\r\nFor instance, if I wanted to turn on Fantasy commands in #topgear, Iâ€™d use this command:\r\n/bs set #topgear fantasy on\r\nOnce Fantasy commands are turned on, you can use any of the commands below, as long as you have the proper access. In other words, you cannot kick someone if youâ€™re not a hop or op on the channel.\r\n\r\n[u][b]General Commands[/b][/u]\r\n \r\n!HELP\r\n Syntax: !HELP\r\n \r\n Help for BotServ fantasy commands\r\n \r\n!CMDLIST\r\n Syntax: !CMDLIST\r\n \r\n  A list of all available fantasy commands\r\n \r\n!IRCOPS\r\n Syntax: !IRCOPS\r\n \r\n  Shows a list of all available global IRCops in the Status Window\r\n \r\n!STAFF\r\n Syntax: !STAFF\r\n \r\n  Shows a list of all available global IRCops in the Status Window\r\n \r\n!MINFO\r\n Syntax: !MINFO\r\n \r\n Shows information about the module providing the brunt \r\n of the fantasy commands.\r\n \r\n!SVERSION\r\n Syntax: !SVERSION\r\n \r\n Shows information about the Anope IRC Services version \r\n and build.\r\n \r\n!INFO\r\n Syntax: !INFO [ALL]\r\n \r\n  Shows information about the channel. \r\n The \'all\' option is limited to founders and Services Admins.\r\n \r\n[u][b]Access Control Commands[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n!SOP\r\n Syntax: !SOP add nick\r\n         !SOP del {nick | entry-num | list}\r\n         !SOP list [mask | list]\r\n         !SOP clear\r\n \r\n Maintains the SOP (SuperOP) list for the channel.\r\n The SOP list gives users all rights given by the AOP list, and adds\r\n those needed to use the AutoKick and the BadWords lists,\r\n to send and read channel memos, and so on.\r\n  \r\n This command may have been disabled for your channel, and\r\n in that case you need to use the access list.

Note,\r\n however, that unlike the /MODE command, each use of\r\n SET MLOCK will remove all modes previously locked before\r\n setting the new!\r\n \r\n Warning:  If you set a mode-locked key, as in the second\r\n example below, you should also set the RESTRICTED option for\r\n the channel (see HELP SET RESTRICTED), or anyone entering\r\n the channel when it is empty will be able to see the key!\r\n \r\n Examples:\r\n \r\n     SET #channel MLOCK +nt-iklps\r\n         Forces modes n and t on, and modes i, k, l, p, and\r\n         s off.  Mode m is left free to be either on or off.\r\n \r\n     SET #channel MLOCK +knst-ilmp my-key\r\n         Forces modes k, n, s, and t on, and modes i, l, m,\r\n         and p off.  Also forces the channel key to be\r\n         \"my-key\".\r\n \r\n     SET #channel MLOCK +\r\n         Removes the mode lock; all channel modes are free\r\n         to be either on or off.\r\n		 [/quote]\r\n[b]SET PEACE[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel PEACE {ON | OFF}\r\n \r\n Enables or disables the peace option for a channel.\r\n When peace is set, an user won\'t be able to kick,\r\n ban or remove a channel status of an user that has\r\n a level superior or equal to his via ChanServ commands.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]SET PRIVATE[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel PRIVATE {ON | OFF}\r\n \r\n Enables or disables the private option for a channel.\r\n When private is set, a /msg ChanServ LIST will not\r\n include the channel in any lists.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]SET RESTRICTED[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  SET channel RESTRICTED {ON | OFF}\r\n \r\n Enables or disables the restricted access option for a\r\n channel.

NickServ Commands','In depth description of NickServ Commands','[align=center][b][size=2]NickServ Commands[/size][/b][/align]\r\n\r\nNickServ allows you to â€œregisterâ€ a nickname and prevent others from using it. The following commands allow for registration and maintenance of nicknames; to use them, type /msg NickServ command. For more information on a specific command, type /msg NickServ HELP command.\r\n \r\n[b]REGISTER[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ REGISTER password [email]\r\n \r\n Registers your nickname in the NickServ database.  Once\r\n your nick is registered, you can use the SET and ACCESS\r\n commands to configure your nick\'s settings as you like\r\n them.  Make sure you remember the password you use when\r\n registering - you\'ll need it to make changes to your nick\r\n later.  (Note that case matters!  ANOPE, Anope, and\r\n anope are all different passwords!)\r\n \r\n Guidelines on choosing passwords:\r\n \r\n Passwords should not be easily guessable.  For example,\r\n using your real name as a password is a bad idea.  Using\r\n your nickname as a password is a much worse idea ;) and,\r\n in fact, NickServ will not allow it.  Also, short\r\n passwords are vulnerable to trial-and-error searches, so\r\n you should choose a password at least 5 characters long.\r\n Finally, the space character cannot be used in passwords.\r\n \r\n The parameter email is optional and will set the email\r\n for your nick immediately. However, it may be required\r\n on certain networks.\r\n Your privacy is respected; this e-mail won\'t be given to\r\n any third-party person.\r\n \r\n This command also creates a new group for your nickname,\r\n that will allow you to register other nicks later sharing\r\n the same configuration, the same set of memos and the\r\n same channel privileges. For more information on this\r\n feature, type /msg NickServ HELP GROUP.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]GROUP[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  GROUP target password\r\n \r\n This command makes your nickname join the target nickname\'s\r\n group. password is the password of the target nickname.\r\n \r\n Joining a group will allow you to share your configuration,\r\n memos, and channel privileges with all the nicknames in the\r\n group, and much more!\r\n \r\n A group exists as long as it is useful. This means that even\r\n if a nick of the group is dropped, you won\'t lose the\r\n shared things described above, as long as there is at\r\n least one nick remaining in the group.\r\n \r\n You can use this command even if you have not registered\r\n your nick yet. If your nick is already registered, you\'ll\r\n need to identify yourself before using this command. Type\r\n /msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more information. This\r\n last may be not possible on your IRC network.\r\n \r\n It is recommended to use this command with a non-registered\r\n nick because it will be registered automatically when\r\n using this command. You may use it with a registered nick (to\r\n change your group) only if your network administrators allowed\r\n it.\r\n \r\n You can only be in one group at a time. Group merging is\r\n not possible.\r\n \r\n Note: all the nicknames of a group have the same password.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]IDENTIFY[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  IDENTIFY password\r\n \r\n Tells NickServ that you are really the owner of this\r\n nick.  Many commands require you to authenticate yourself\r\n with this command before you use them.  The password\r\n should be the same one you sent with the REGISTER\r\n command.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]LOGOUT[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  LOGOUT\r\n \r\n This reverses the effect of the IDENTIFY command, i.e.\r\n make you not recognized as the real owner of the nick\r\n anymore. Note, however, that you won\'t be asked to reidentify\r\n yourself.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]DROP[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  DROP [nickname]\r\n \r\n Drops your nickname from the NickServ database.  A nick\r\n that has been dropped is free for anyone to re-register.\r\n \r\n You may drop a nick within your group by passing it\r\n as the nick parameter.\r\n \r\n In order to use this command, you must first identify\r\n with your password (/msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more\r\n information).[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]ACCESS[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  ACCESS ADD mask\r\n         ACCESS DEL mask\r\n         ACCESS LIST\r\n \r\n Modifies or displays the access list for your nick.  This\r\n is the list of addresses which will be automatically\r\n recognized by NickServ as allowed to use the nick.  If\r\n you want to use the nick from a different address, you\r\n need to send an IDENTIFY command to make NickServ\r\n recognize you.\r\n \r\n Examples:\r\n \r\n     ACCESS ADD anyone@*.bepeg.com\r\n         Allows access to user anyone from any machine in\r\n         the bepeg.com domain.\r\n \r\n     ACCESS DEL anyone@*.bepeg.com\r\n         Reverses the previous command.\r\n \r\n     ACCESS LIST\r\n         Displays the current access list.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET option parameters\r\n \r\n Sets various nickname options.  option can be one of:\r\n \r\n     DISPLAY    Set the display of your group in Services\r\n     PASSWORD   Set your nickname password\r\n     LANGUAGE   Set the language Services will use when\r\n                    sending messages to you\r\n     URL        Associate a URL with your nickname\r\n     EMAIL      Associate an E-mail address with your nickname\r\n     ICQ        Associate an ICQ number with your nickname\r\n     GREET      Associate a greet message with your nickname\r\n     KILL       Turn protection on or off\r\n     SECURE     Turn nickname security on or off\r\n     PRIVATE    Prevent your nickname from appearing in a\r\n                    /msg NickServ LIST\r\n     HIDE       Hide certain pieces of nickname information\r\n     MSG        Change the communication method of Services\r\n     AUTOOP     Should services op you automatically.\r\n \r\n In order to use this command, you must first identify\r\n with your password (/msg NickServ HELP IDENTIFY for more\r\n information).\r\n \r\n Type /msg NickServ HELP SET option for more information\r\n on a specific option.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]SET DISPLAY[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET DISPLAY new-display\r\n \r\n Changes the display used to refer to your nickname group in\r\n Services.

You can hide your E-mail address (EMAIL), last seen\r\n user@host mask (USERMASK), your services access status\r\n (STATUS) and  last quit message (QUIT).\r\n The second parameter specifies whether the information should\r\n be displayed (OFF) or hidden (ON).[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]SET ICQ[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET ICQ number\r\n \r\n Associates the given ICQ number with your nickname.  This\r\n number will be displayed whenever someone requests\r\n information on your nick with the INFO command.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]SET GREET[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET GREET message\r\n \r\n Makes the given message the greet of your nickname, that\r\n will be displayed when joining a channel that has GREET\r\n option enabled, provided that you have the necessary\r\n access on it.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET KILL[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET KILL {ON | QUICK | IMMED | OFF}\r\n \r\n Turns the automatic protection option for your nick\r\n on or off.  With protection on, if another user\r\n tries to take your nick, they will be given one minute to\r\n change to another nick, after which NickServ will forcibly change\r\n their nick.\r\n \r\n If you select QUICK, the user will be given only 20 seconds\r\n to change nicks instead of the usual 60.  If you select\r\n IMMED, user\'s nick will be changed immediately without being\r\n warned first or given a chance to change their nick; please\r\n do not use this option unless necessary.  Also, your\r\n network\'s administrators may have disabled this option.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET SECURE[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET SECURE {ON | OFF}\r\n \r\n Turns NickServ\'s security features on or off for your\r\n nick.  With SECURE set, you must enter your password\r\n before you will be recognized as the owner of the nick,\r\n regardless of whether your address is on the access\r\n list.  However, if you are on the access list, NickServ\r\n will not auto-kill you regardless of the setting of the\r\n KILL option.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET PRIVATE[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET PRIVATE {ON | OFF}\r\n \r\n Turns NickServ\'s privacy option on or off for your nick.\r\n With PRIVATE set, your nickname will not appear in\r\n nickname lists generated with NickServ\'s LIST command.\r\n (However, anyone who knows your nickname can still get\r\n information on it using the INFO command.)[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]SET MSG[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  SET MSG {ON | OFF}\r\n \r\n Allows you to choose the way Services are communicating with\r\n you.

This causes the IRC\r\n servers to disconnect the other user.  This fake user will\r\n remain online for NickServ to ensure that the other\r\n user does not immediately reconnect; after that time, you\r\n can reclaim your nick.  Alternatively, use the RELEASE\r\n command (/msg NickServ HELP RELEASE) to get the nick\r\n back sooner.\r\n \r\n In order to use the RECOVER command for a nick, your\r\n current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick\'s\r\n access list, you must be identified and in the group of\r\n that nick, or you must supply the correct password for\r\n the nickname.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]RELEASE[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  RELEASE nickname [password]\r\n \r\n Instructs NickServ to remove any hold on your nickname\r\n caused by automatic kill protection or use of the RECOVER\r\n command.  This holds lasts for NickServ;\r\n this command gets rid of them sooner.\r\n \r\n In order to use the RELEASE command for a nick, your\r\n current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick\'s\r\n access list, you must be identified and in the group of\r\n that nick, or you must supply the correct password for\r\n the nickname.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]GHOST[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  GHOST nickname [password]\r\n \r\n Terminates a \"ghost\" IRC session using your nick.  A\r\n \"ghost\" session is one which is not actually connected,\r\n but which the IRC server believes is still online for one\r\n reason or another.  Typically, this happens if your\r\n computer crashes or your Internet or modem connection\r\n goes down while you\'re on IRC.\r\n \r\n In order to use the GHOST command for a nick, your\r\n current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick\'s\r\n access list, you must be identified and in the group of\r\n that nick, or you must supply the correct password for\r\n the nickname.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]INFO[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  INFO nickname [ALL]\r\n \r\n Displays information about the given nickname, such as\r\n the nick\'s owner, last seen address and time, and nick\r\n options. If you are identified for the nick you\'re\r\n getting information for and ALL is specified, you will\r\n be shown all the information; regardless of whether\r\n it\'s hidden or not.[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]LIST[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  LIST pattern\r\n \r\n Lists all registered nicknames which match the given\r\n pattern, in nick!user@host format.  Nicks with the\r\n PRIVATE option set will not be displayed.\r\n \r\n Examples:\r\n \r\n     LIST *!joeuser@foo.com\r\n         Lists all nicks owned by joeuser@foo.com.\r\n \r\n     LIST *Bot*!*@*\r\n         Lists all registered nicks with Bot in their\r\n         names (case insensitive).\r\n \r\n     LIST *!*@*.bar.org\r\n         Lists all nicks owned by users in the bar.org\r\n         domain.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]ALIST[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  ALIST [level]\r\n \r\n Lists all channels you have access on. Optionally, you can specify\r\n a level in XOP or ACCESS format. The resulting list will only\r\n include channels where you have the given level of access.\r\n\r\n Examples:\r\n     ALIST Founder\r\n         Lists all channels where you have Founder\r\n         access.\r\n\r\n     ALIST AOP\r\n         Lists all channels where you have AOP\r\n         access or greater.\r\n\r\n     ALIST 10\r\n         Lists all channels where you have level 10\r\n         access or greater.\r\n\r\n Channels that have the NOEXPIRE option set will be\r\n prefixed by an exclamation mark.[/quote]\r\n[b]GLIST[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  GLIST\r\n \r\n Lists all nicks in your group.[/quote]\r\n[b]STATUS[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg NickServ  STATUS nickname...\r\n \r\n Returns whether the user using the given nickname is\r\n recognized as the owner of the nickname.  The response has\r\n this format:\r\n \r\n     nickname status-code\r\n \r\n where nickname is the nickname sent with the command, and\r\n status-code is one of the following:\r\n \r\n     0 - no such user online or nickname not registered\r\n     1 - user not recognized as nickname\'s owner\r\n     2 - user recognized as owner via access list only\r\n     3 - user recognized as owner via password identification\r\n \r\n Up to sixteen nicknames may be sent with each command; the\r\n rest will be ignored.

These include:\r\n\r\nIncreased control over your channel\r\nAbility to add people to the auto op list\r\nAbility to add auto kicks\r\nAbility to use a services bot to auto moderate your channel\r\nAnd many many moreâ€¦\r\nTo register your channel, you must first register your nickname. To do this, when you are using the nickname that you wish to register, type the following command into your IRC client:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns register password e-mail[/quote]\r\n\r\nYou must replace password and e-mail with a real password and e-mail address, respectively. An example of the use of this command is:\r\n\r\n[quote]/ns register supersecretpassword fred@hotmail.com[/quote]\r\n\r\nIt is important that you use your real e-mail address as this will be used in future if you ever forget your password. We will not send any unsolicited e-mail to this address.\r\n\r\nOnce you have registered your nickname, you can register your channel. All channels names begin with the # symbol, for example #help, #chris and #247fixes. Once you have picked a channel name, you can join it using the command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/join #channel[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[quote]/join #chat[/quote]\r\n\r\nOnce you have joined the channel, if it is not already registered, you should see your name in the nickname list with the @ symbol next to it. This means you are an operator in the channel. You may now register it with the following command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/cs register #channel password description[/quote]\r\n\r\nYou must replace #channel, password and description with the channel name, the channel password and a description of the channel. An example of the use of this command is:\r\n\r\n[quote]/cs register #chat verysecretpassword Freds chat channel[/quote]\r\n\r\nOnce you have done that, you should see your name in the nick list prefixed with the ~ symbol. This means you are the owner of the channel.\r\n\r\nOn Empornium IRC a Services Bot will automatically be assigned to your channel. You can change or remove it later.\r\n\r\n[#=chan-hide][/#][b]Hide your Channel[/b]\r\n\r\nSecret vs. Private:\r\n\r\nThere are two modes you can use to hide your channel: [b]+s[/b], for a secret channel; and [b]+p[/b], for a private channel.\r\n\r\nOriginally (that is, in earlier days of IRC), there was a difference between these two modes. On Empornium IRC, the two commands do the same thing. If you set your channel to [b]+p[/b] or to [b]+s[/b], your channel will not show up in the channel listing that someone gets after using the /LIST command and in a /WHOIS list for a user who is in the channel (unless the person using the command is also in the secret channel)\r\n\r\nSince the two commands do the same thing, you can only set one or the other.\r\n\r\nSetting the Secret or Private Mode:\r\n\r\nTo set the secret mode, use this command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #channel +s[/quote]\r\n\r\nIn that command, replace \"channel\" with your #channel. For instance, for my super-secret channel, I used this command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #baconmylove +s[/quote] \r\n\r\nTo set the private mode, use this command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #channel +p[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor instance, I used this command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #baconmylove +p[/quote]\r\n  \r\nRestrictions on the +s and +p Modes:\r\n\r\nIf you set your channel to +s and then decide to set +p, the server will respond by removing the +s setting. Youâ€™d see something like this:\r\n\r\n[quote]* MrRandom sets mode: +s\r\n* MrRandom sets mode: +p-s[/quote]\r\n\r\nIn the second line, the server set +p (adding the private setting), and [b]-s[/b] (removing the secret setting). This is normal. Since the commands do the same thing, you only need one or the other (never both). As long as you have the channel set to [b]+s[/b] or to [b]+p[/b], it will be hidden.\r\n\r\nRemoving the Secret or Private Mode:\r\n\r\nIf you no longer want your channel to be hidden, you can remove the secret or private mode easily:\r\n\r\nTo remove the secret mode, use this command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #channel -s[/quote]\r\n\r\nTo remove the private mode, use this command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #channel -p[/quote]\r\n\r\nOnce you remove the setting, your channel will be visible to everyone on the network.\r\n\r\nTwo Tips on Using the Secret or Private Mode:\r\n\r\nRemember that even though your channel is hidden, the people you ask to join you in the channel can tell others about it. Only invite people to join your channel if you trust them to maintain your privacy. If you cannot trust someone not to tell others about the space, donâ€™t ask them to join your channel.\r\n\r\nAny moderator (half-ops, ops, and admins) on your channel can change the channel mode. Donâ€™t add someone as a moderator in the channel if you cannot trust that person to leave the channel with the settings you want.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#=chan-password][/#][b][size=3]Channel Passwords[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nIf you ever had a secret password to get into your clubhouse, you understand the way that channel keys work. You can set a channel key for your channel, and only those people who have the key will be able to join the channel. If you want to have private conversations, using a channel key is a simple way to make it happen.\r\n\r\nSetting a Channel Key:\r\n\r\nTo set a channel key, use this command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #channel +k channelkey[/quote] \r\n\r\nIn that command, replace \"channel\" with your #channel and replace \"channelkey\" with your channel key (your password). For instance, for my super-secret channel, I used this command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #baconmylove +k nomnomnom [/quote] \r\n\r\nWhen you set a channel key, everyone in the channel will see the new key. When I set my channel key, for instance, the server announced this in the channel:\r\n\r\n * MrRandom sets mode: +k nomnomnom\r\n\r\nTips:\r\n\r\nBe sure that you choose a strong password that others will not easily guess. \r\n\r\nMake sure you remove anyone you do not want to have the key before you set it. You can ask him to leave OR kick and ban if necessary. Remember that the server announces the key in channel when you set it, so everyone in your channel will see the new key.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has half-op status or higher in your channel can change the channel key. If you cannot trust someone, donâ€™t make that person a moderator. He could easily change the password and lock everyone out of the channel! This can be fixed by doing [quote]/cs clear #channel modes[/quote]\r\n\r\nThe channel key will only remain as long as someone is in the channel. If everyone leaves, the next person who joins will be able to do so without knowing the channel key. The easiest solution to this problem is either to add a bnc user to the channel or create a private bot to occupy the channel. Note that services bots will not hold a channel open.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoining a Channel with a Key:\r\n\r\nYou need to provide the password to join your channel now once you set your key. Hereâ€™s how to use the JOIN command with a channel key:\r\n\r\n[quote]/join #channel password[/quote]\r\n\r\nFor my super-secret channel, I used this command:\r\n\r\n[quote]/join #baconmylove nomnomnom[/quote]\r\n\r\nYouâ€™ll need to give your password and this command to everyone who you want to grant access to your channel. Only give your channel password to the people you trust with access to your private space.\r\n\r\nChanging your Channel Key:\r\n\r\nTo change your channel key, just use the same command with a new password:\r\n\r\n/mode #channel +k newchannelkey \r\nThe command is exactly the same. You just indicate the new channel key when you use the command.\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting:\r\n\r\nYou see this error message in your status window: #channel :Cannot join channel (+k)\r\nEither you didnâ€™t include the password or you used the wrong password. Check with the channel owner for the correct password or to ask for access to the channel.\r\n\r\nYou get locked out of your own channel.\r\nIf you forget your password or someone else changes it, you can just change your channel key and join with the new key. If a moderator in your channel changed the password without your permission, you may want to talk to that person or remove his access. Remember you should only add people as half-ops, ops, or admins if you trust them completely.\r\n\r\nIf you are an owner who gets locked out of your channel join the network help channel #silentzombies-help @ irc.emprn.tk they will help you get your channel back.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#=chan-mode][/#][size=3][b]Channel Modes[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nThis section lists all of the possible channel modes that may be used with /MODE\r\n\r\nAn example of the use of this command is: /mode #chills +o Brigitte\r\n\r\n[b]Mode[/b]\r\na = Gives Channel Admin to the user\r\nA = Server/Network Admin only channel (settable by Admins)\r\nb = Bans the nick!ident@host from the channel.\r\n       Extended bantypes are also available.

This mode allows you to prevent join, nick change, CTCP, text, and knock floods. The syntax for this modeâ€™s parameter is as follows:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #channel +f [{#}{,...}]:[/quote]\r\n\r\nThe amount specifies the number of times the specified flood must occur before action is taken. \r\n\r\nBelow are the available types:\r\n\r\n[table]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td] Type [/td][td] Name [/td][td] Default Action [/td][td] Other Actions [/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td] c [/td][td] CTCP [/td][td] +C (no channel CTCPs allowed) [/td][td] +m (only voiced users can speak), +M (only registered users can speak) [/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td] j [/td][td] Join [/td][td] +i (invite only) [/td][td] R (only registered users can join) [/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td] k [/td][td] Knock [/td][td] +K (no knocks allowed) [/td][td] None [/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td] m [/td][td] Message [/td][td] +m (only voiced users can speak) [/td][td] +M (only registered users can speak) [/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td] n [/td][td] Nickname Change [/td][td] +N (no nickname changes allowed) [/td][td] None [/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n[td] t [/td][td] text [/td][td] User is kicked from the channel [/td][td] +b (user is banned from the channel) [/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/table]\r\n\r\nN.B. The difference between type [b]m[/b] and [b]t[/b] is that [b]m[/b] is tallied for the entire channel whereas [b]t[/b] is tallied per user.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to specify an action for a mode, you may also specify a time (in minutes) after which the specific action will be reversed.\r\n\r\nAn example of the use of this command is:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #chills +f [2c#C5,6j#R3,3k#K10,15m#m5,5n#N3,5t#b60]:5[/quote]\r\n\r\nThis meansâ€¦\r\n\r\nIf there are 2 channel CTCP messages (2c) in 5 seconds(:5) set mode +C for 5 mins (#C5)\r\nIf there are 6 joins (6j) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +R for 3 mins (#R3)\r\nIf there are 3 /KNOCK commands on the channel (3k) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +K for 10 mins (#K10)\r\nIf there are 15 messages in total from all users (15m) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +m for 5 mins (#m5)\r\nIf there are 5 nickname changes (n5) in 5 seconds (:5) set mode +N for 3 mins (#N3)\r\nIf there are 5 messages from any single user (5t) in 5 seconds (:5) ban the user for 60 mins (#b60)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been observed lately that bot nets are joining channels and rapidly joining and parting. In order to prevent this, you can use channel mode [b]j[/b]. This mode will allow only x joins to your channel in y seconds for each client. The recommended setting for this is 1 join in 1 second as this will entirely eradicate join/part flooding from botnets. An example of the use of this is:\r\n\r\n[quote]/mode #chills +j 1:1[/quote]\r\n\r\n[#=ban-options][/#][b][size=3]Different banning options Senior staff ONLY (e.g IRC Operators)[/size][/b]\r\n\r\nProceed with caution.

ChanServ Commands','In depth description of ChanServ Commands','[align=center][b][size=2]ChanServ Commands[/size][/b][/align]\r\n\r\nChanServ allows you to register and control various aspects of channels. ChanServ can often prevent malicious users from â€œtaking overâ€ channels by limiting who is allowed channel operator privileges. Available commands are listed below; to use them, type [quote]/msg ChanServ command[/quote]. For more information on a specific command, type [quote]/msg ChanServ HELP command[/quote]\r\n \r\n[b]REGISTER[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  REGISTER channel password description\r\n \r\n Registers a channel in the ChanServ database.  In order\r\n to use this command, you must first be a channel operator\r\n on the channel you\'re trying to register.  The password\r\n is used with the IDENTIFY command to allow others to\r\n make changes to the channel settings at a later time.\r\n The last parameter, which must be included, is a\r\n general description of the channel\'s purpose.\r\n \r\n When you register a channel, you are recorded as the\r\n \"founder\" of the channel.  The channel founder is allowed\r\n to change all of the channel settings for the channel;\r\n ChanServ will also automatically give the founder\r\n channel-operator privileges when s/he enters the channel.\r\n See the ACCESS command (/msg ChanServ HELP ACCESS) for\r\n information on giving a subset of these privileges to\r\n other channel users.\r\n \r\n NOTICE: In order to register a channel, you must have\r\n first registered your nickname.  If you haven\'t,\r\n /msg ChanServ HELP for information on how to do so.[/quote]\r\n\r\n[b]IDENTIFY[/b]\r\n[quote] Syntax: /msg ChanServ  IDENTIFY channel password\r\n \r\n Authenticates you to ChanServ as the founder of the given\r\n channel.

Make uploads, grab torrents, bookmark stuff, make posts, subscribe, look at your user history, report stuff (you can make bogus reports etc for testing), test everything! [b]It would be great if you could start a few of your old torrents too help us out with testing the tracker for a few days too.[/b]\r\n\r\n[b]We like bug reports[/b] :chase: \r\n- If you find something that you think is wrong, report it! Look for any previous identical reports and add it to an appropriate thread if it already exists, otherwise make a new thread in the bug forum. We would rather have duplicate reports than miss something! Bug reports dont have to be actual software bugs, anything you dont understand or think needs better explaining tell us, anything you think needs changing tell us, we may not agree but we do want all opinions :D\r\n\r\n[b]What happens on the test tracker stays on the test tracker![/b]  :shutup2: \r\n- Meaning that all stats on the test tracker will be wiped out when we go live.

As there are no seeders on the test site announce url currently the torrents will look dead.

It contains some basic guidelines to testing and bug hunting aswell as some things that we already found. If you think that this guide is not complete or if it is incorrect please send me a PM or reply in this thread.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]How to submit a bug report[/b][/size]\r\n\r\nLet\'s start with the most important information first. What do do when you find a bug. \r\n\r\nTo tell us about it we need specific information:\r\n\r\n\r\nNow for some simple guidelines when you want to share you bug with the coders.\r\n \r\n[*]Search the forum to see if the bug is already known.\r\n[*]If the bug is indeed new then start a new topic. As a topic name please use following: Location - Desription of bug. With location I mean things like [Forum] or [Torrent Details]. Example: [Torrent Upload] - My cover image is not accepted.\r\n[*]Fill the topic with as much information as you possibly can. Use images if it is hard to describe what is happening. Be sure to atleast give the information as noted in the following 3 bullets.\r\n[*][b]The page url[/b] For example the url for the browse torrents page is [code]http://empornium.mooo.com/torrents.php[/code] which when written in a post becomes: http://empornium.mooo.com/torrents.php\r\n[*][b]What is wrong[/b] Tell us what the problem is, and if applicable the way you expect it to work.\r\n[*][b]How to reproduce it[/b] Please include enough information so that we can reproduce the bug ourselves. Reproduce it yourself first if possible, and make a note of what actions produce the bug.\r\n[*]Keep track of your topic (potentially subscribe to it). Coders might require additional information or another tester might want to do additional tests working together with you.\r\n \r\n[size=3][b]How to hunt for bugs[/b][/size]\r\n \r\nThere is no set way in which one can hunt for a bug. The reason for this is that no one knows where the bugs are located. There are however a few simple pointers that you can follow while hunting:\r\n \r\n[*][b]Work systematically[/b] In other words don\'t go clicking haphazardly because that way it is almost impossible to reproduce what you did when things go wrong.\r\n[*][b]Test things multiple times[/b] A result could always be a fluke. This goes for both bugs and correct functionality. If you test something several times and the same thing always happens then you either have a bug that you can reproduce or you have correct behaviour that you can vouch for.\r\n[*][b]Test again at a later time[/b] Some bugs are easy to fix, others are a lot more complicated. To ensure that a bug is truly gone or that an old bug doesn\'t reappear it is always advisable to test features again a week later and yet again the next week. It would suck if 2 weeks after going live a bug reappears because it  is date triggered and happens every 2 weeks or something.\r\n[*][b]Don\'t assume anything[/b] As they say: \"Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups\". If you think something works then please make sure that it does.\r\n \r\n \r\nPlease note that this list probably is not complete and is therefor subject to change. Take a look every once in a while to see if there were changes. Who knows the coders might have noticed that a certain step is not neccessary and you are still doing all that work for nothing!
